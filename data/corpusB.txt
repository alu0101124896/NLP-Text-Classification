"The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck: A Counterintuitive Approach to Living a Good Life Review “Resilience  happiness and freedom come from knowing what to care about--and most importantly  what not to care about. This is a masterful  philosophical and practical book that will give readers the wisdom to be able to do just that.” (Ryan Holiday  New York Times bestselling author of The Obstacle is the Way and Ego is the Enemy)“Mark’s ability to dig deep and offer amazing  yet counter-intuitive  insight into the challenges of life makes him one of my favorite writers  and this book is his best work yet.” (Matt Kepnes  New York Times bestselling author of Travel the World on $50 a Day: Travel Cheaper  Longer  Smarter)“This book hits you like a much-needed slap in the face from your best friend: hilarious  vulgar  and immensely thought-provoking. Only read if you’re willing to set aside all excuses and take an active role in living a f***ing better life.” (Steve Kamb  bestselling author of Level Up Your Life and founder of NerdFitness.com)“The opposite of every other book. Don’t try. Give up. Be wrong. Lower your standards. Stop believing in yourself. Follow the pain. Each point is profoundly true  useful  and more powerful than the usual positivity. Succinct but surprisingly deep  I read it in one night.” (Derek Sivers  Founder of CD Baby and author of Anything You Want: 40 Lessons for a New Kind of Entrepreneur)“An in-your-face guide to living with integrity and finding happiness in sometimes-painful places… This book  full of counterintuitive suggestions that often make great sense  is a pleasure to read and worthy of rereading. A good yardstick by which self-improvement books should be measured.” (Kirkus Reviews) 				    	 					 From the Back Cover New York Times Bestseller In this generation-defining self-help guide  a superstar blogger shows us that the key to being happier is to stop trying to be “positive” all the time and instead to become better at handling adversity.For decades we’ve been told that positive thinking is the key to a happy  rich life. But those days are over. “Fuck positivity ” Mark Manson says. “Let’s be honest  sometimes things are fucked up and we have to live with it.” For the past few years  Manson—via his wildly popular blog—has been working on correcting our delusional expectations for ourselves and for the world. He now brings his hard-fought wisdom to this groundbreaking book.Manson makes the argument—backed by both academic research and well-timed poop jokes—that improving our lives hinges not on our ability to turn lemons into lemonade  but on learning to better stomach lemons. Human beings are flawed and limited—as he writes  “Not everybody can be extraordinary—there are winners and losers in society  and some of it is not fair or your fault.” Manson advises us to get to know our limitations and accept them. This  he says  is the real source of empowerment. Once we embrace our fears  faults  and uncertainties—once we stop running from and avoiding  and start confronting painful truths—we can begin to find the courage and confidence we desperately seek.“In life  we have a limited amount of fucks to give. So you must choose your fucks wisely.” Manson brings a much-needed grab-you-by-the-shoulders moment of real-talk  filled with entertaining stories and profane  ruthless humor. This manifesto is a refreshing slap in the face for all of us so that we can start to lead more contented  grounded lives.              See all Product description"

Searching Eyes: Privacy  the State  and Disease Surveillance in America is a major achievement in interdisciplinary scholarship and historical interpretation  and will remain the definitive work on this important subject for many years to come.""Theodore M. Brown  Ph.D.  Professor of History  Community and Preventive Medicine  and Medical Humanities  University of Rochester""A landmark in the history and ethics of public health.

"Foundations of Quantum Theory: From Classical Concepts to Operator Algebras (Fundamental Theories of Physics) Review ""Quantum theory has frequent applications in the subjects of quantum information theory and quantum optics. The purpose of this book is to present the foundations of quantum theory in connection with classical physics  from the point of view of classical-quantum duality. ... This good book is recommended for mathematicians  physicists  philosophers of physics  researchers and advanced students in this field."" (Michael M. Dediu  Mathematical Reviews  Decemeber  2017) 				    	 					 From the Back Cover This book studies the foundations of quantum theory through its relationship to classical physics. This idea goes back to the Copenhagen Interpretation (in the original version due to Bohr and Heisenberg)  which the author relates to the mathematical formalism of operator algebras originally created by von Neumann. The book therefore includes comprehensive appendices on functional analysis and C*-algebras  as well as a briefer one on logic  category theory  and topos theory. Matters of foundational as well as mathematical interest that are covered in detail include symmetry (and its ""spontaneous"" breaking)  the measurement problem  the Kochen-Specker  Free Will  and Bell Theorems  the Kadison-Singer conjecture  quantization  indistinguishable particles  the quantum theory of large systems  and quantum logic  the latter in connection with the topos approach to quantum theory.This book is Open Access under a CC BY licence.

"It's Not about the Bike: My Journey Back to Life Amazon.com Review People around the world have found inspiration in the story of Lance Armstrong--a world-class athlete nearly struck down by cancer  only to recover and win the Tour de France  the multiday bicycle race famous for its grueling intensity. Armstrong is a thoroughgoing Texan jock  and the changes brought to his life by his illness are startling and powerful  but he's just not interested in wearing a hero suit. While his vocabulary is a bit on the he-man side (highest compliment to his wife: ""she's a stud"")  his actions will melt the most hard-bitten souls: a cancer foundation and benefit bike ride  his astonishing commitment to training that got him past countless hurdles  loyalty to the people and corporations that never gave up on him. There's serious medical detail here  which may not be for the faint of heart  from chemo to surgical procedures to his wife's in vitro fertilization  you won't be spared a single x-ray  IV drip  or unfortunate side effect. Athletes and coaches everywhere will benefit from the same extraordinary detail provided about his training sessions--every aching tendon  every rainy afternoon  and every small triumph during his long recovery is here in living color. It's Not About the Bike is the perfect title for this book about life  death  illness  family  setbacks  and triumphs  but not especially about the bike. --Jill Lightner  From Booklist It is such an all-American story. A lanky kid from Plano  Texas  is raised by a feisty  single parent who sacrifices for her son  who becomes one of our country's greatest athletes. Given that background  it is understandable why Armstrong was able to channel his boundless energy toward athletic endeavors. By his senior year in high school  he was already a professional triathlete and was training with the U.S. Olympic cycling developmental team. In 1993  Armstrong secured a position in the ranks of world-class cyclists by winning the World Championship and a Tour de France stage  but in 1996  he was diagnosed with testicular cancer. Armstrong entered an unknown battlefield and challenged it as if climbing through the Alps: aggressive yet tactical. He beat the cancer and proceeded to stun all the pundits by winning the 1999 Tour de France. In this memoir  Armstrong covers his early years swiftly with a blunt matter-of-factness  but the main focus is on his battle with cancer. Readers will respond to the inspirational recovery story  and they will appreciate the behind-the-scenes cycling information. After he won the Tour  his mother was quoted as saying that her son's whole life has been a fight against the odds  we see here that she was not exaggerating.

(Rachel Cooke Observer)""Mr Lloyd Parry offers a voice to the grieving who  too often  found it hard to be heard.

Saturn's Moons: W.G Sebald: A Handbook (Legenda Main) The German novelist  poet and critic W. G.

Saturns Moons: a W. G. Sebald Handbook brings together in one volume a wealth of new critical and visual material on Sebalds life and works  encompassing a range of first-hand accounts by his former colleagues and students.

The Difficulty of being Good: On the Subtle Art of Dharma Review ''The book is a wonderful combination of the scholarly and the personal  the academic and the meditative. The basic plan works beautifully  building a rich mix of his very  very careful and detailed reading of the text  his other wide reading  and his life in business  an extraordinary blend. I found the use of evolutionary biology and the Prisoner's Dilemma to explain the pragmatism of the Mahabharata absolutely brilliant.'' --Wendy Doniger  Mircea Eliade Professor of the History of Religions  University of Chicago ''The book is a remarkable tour de force that connects an ageless philosophical epic to the travails of contemporary society. This book is for the liberal Hindu who does not want his religion co-opted  for the modern Indian who wants to build a fair and inclusive society and for the global citizen who is rendered asunder by moral absolutism. The dharmic challenges we face every day resonate throughout Gurcharan's book. Reading this book has been an enriching experience!''  --Nandan Nilekani  author of Imagining India ''Through a series of bravura readings of the Mahabharata  Gurcharan Das makes a learned and passionate attempt to inform how the great Indian epic might illuminate our present-day moral dilemmas. Readers will find his analyses of dharma insightful  challenging  and honest--doing full justice to the world's most complex  exciting and honest poem.   This admirable book offers precisely the kind of reflection that the epic itself invites--moral  political and public. It shows why the Mahabharata is a classic: because it is ever timely. This superb book is knowledgeable  passionate  and even courageous. Grounded in a secure knowledge of the narrative  it raises key moral problems--from the doctrine of just war to affirmative action to the nature of suffering--and it makes striking attempts to link these with contemporary discussions and issues  both public and personal.'' --Sheldon Pollock  William B. Ransford Professor of Sanskrit and Indian Studies  Columbia University''The book is a kind of miracle: a deeply sensitive man suddenly decides to leave his usual routines and familiar roles and to spend some years simply reading the Mahabharata and seeing what the ancient epic has to tell him  he engages profoundly with the text  with the bewildering profusion of its messages  its tormented heroes  and the dramatic events it describes  and he then finds the space and the right words for a thoughtful  highly personal  philosophically informed  skeptical  sustained response. Such things happen only rarely in our generation  and we should all be grateful to Gurcharan Das for this gift.'' --David Shulman  Renee Lang Professor of Humanistic Studies  Hebrew University''This book is a triple treat. It provides a subtle reading of episodes in the Mahabharata. It uses those readings to raise consistently provocative questions about the character of dharma. And it addresses important questions about the character of our ethical lives....It wears its learning lightly  prompting one to think  and hence it is a pleasure and a provocation.'' --Pratap Bhanu Mehta  political scientist and president  Centre for Policy Research  New Delhi  ''This wise  passionate  and illuminating book is one of the best things I've read about the contribution of great literature to ethical thought.'' --Martha Nussbaum  Professor of Philosophy  University of Chicago''Gurcharan Das' personal search for dharma in the ancient epic uncovers buried signposts to a desirable future polity. The Difficulty of Being Good is a significant Indian contribution to a new  universal Enlightenment that is not Western in origin or character.

The best part of this book is in the philosophy that motivates it. It doesn't actually teach theology  rather it encourages students to discuss it. The book requires that leaders be ready to lead theological discussions  which can sometimes be more challenging than teaching theology. Use this book to help students dig deeper into what they believe. --The Journal of Student Ministries  Summer 2009Hedges continues the Creative Bible Lessons series with an unbelievable look at the pursuit of theology. With the addition of audio  visual and hands-on activities  this resource provides an excellent opportunity to reach all types of academic learners. I was amazed at the implicit depth of the material. It is a must-have item for all youth pastors seeking to provide a Christian worldview to their students. --Youthworker Journal  September/October 2009 				    	 					 From the Back Cover As a youth worker you have certainly spent much of your time addressing the current issues facing teens  but have you stopped to think about what may be behind students' behavior? Many of the not-so-wise choices students make are the result of a confused worldview that comes from uncertainty about who God is. It's easy for students to dismiss the truth when they learn from the world that all truth is relative.  Creative Bible Lessons: Essential Theology uses a conversational approach to give students a theological foundation to better understand God and his purpose for how to live their lives. Throughout the twelve sessions of this study students will-- â¢ learn how creation provides evidence of God's existence. â¢ look at how God has chosen to reveal himself through his Word.  â¢ learn to live lives that reflect God's love for them. â¢ understand their need for God's direction. â¢ commit to following God's will as they make life decisions. â¢ discover how God's invitation to enter his kingdom affects the direction of their lives. â¢ examine where they are with God on a personal level. Following in the tradition of the bestselling Creative Bible Lessons series  you'll find audio  visual  and hands-on activities to engage your students in the pursuit of theology. And because every student learns differently  each lesson includes options to help you reach your particular group of students  whether they learn best from imaginative  analytic  common sense  or dynamic teaching styles. With all these tools at your disposal you are guaranteed to get your students fired-up for seeking God and his plan for them. 				    	 					              See all Product description"

"Man's Search For Meaning Amazon.com Review Man's Search for Meaning by Viktor E. Frankl is among the most influential works of psychiatric literature since Freud. The book begins with a lengthy  austere  and deeply moving personal essay about Frankl's imprisonment in Auschwitz and other concentration camps for five years  and his struggle during this time to find reasons to live. The second part of the book  called ""Logotherapy in a Nutshell "" describes the psychotherapeutic method that Frankl pioneered as a result of his experiences in the concentration camps. Freud believed that sexual instincts and urges were the driving force of humanity's life  Frankl  by contrast  believes that man's deepest desire is to search for meaning and purpose. Frankl's logotherapy  therefore  is much more compatible with Western religions than Freudian psychotherapy. This is a fascinating  sophisticated  and very human book. At times  Frankl's personal and professional discourses merge into a style of tremendous power. ""Our generation is realistic  for we have come to know man as he really is "" Frankl writes. ""After all  man is that being who invented the gas chambers of Auschwitz  however  he is also that being who entered those gas chambers upright  with the Lord's Prayer or the Shema Yisrael on his lips.""

"The New Tycoons: Inside the Trillion Dollar Private Equity Industry That Owns Everything (Bloomberg) Review Subtitled Inside the Trillion Dollar Private Equity Industry that owns Everything  Kelly tries to demystify the complex world of private equity through telling the stories of the leading characters and key firms in the industry. A Bloomberg news reporter  Kelly is familiar with his subject and he traces the mushrooming of this industry from a relatively small niche area of financial service into a globally powerful phenomenon. The book has a timely edge given the presidential candidacy of Mitt Romney  a former chief executive of Bain Capital  and is certainly well researched. Kelly notes that he is trained to look for surprise and that as he researched the book  the omnipresence of the industry surprised even him. So much is owned by the industry  and the appetite to run the numbers on businesses that are not  appears to be relentless. Kelly does his best to make the complex simple with glossaries and charts  it is a challenging read nonetheless. Although interesting for the general reader  the book will be of most interest to those who work in the global financial services industry and who can relate readily to the firms under consideration here. (Irishtimes.com  November 2012) 				    	 					 From the Inside Flap Private equity is everywhere.Firms like KKR  Blackstone  TPG  and Carlyle have a hand in what we wear and what we eat  by owning some of the world's biggest brands?from Hilton to Dunkin' Donuts and Toys""R""Us to J. Crew. Their influence doesn't stop there. They're investing on behalf of governments  university endowments  and pensions  giving them responsibility for billions in retirement savings. The companies they own employ millions of workers.In The New Tycoons  Bloomberg News reporter Jason Kelly demystifies the complex world of private equity by telling the stories of the top firms and their leaders. The book details how their role as investors  owners  and employers has put them at the center of our lives.Through in-depth  exclusive interviews with private equity chieftains including Stephen Schwarzman  David Rubenstein  David Bonderman  Henry Kravis  and others  The New Tycoons explores a cottage investing industry that's blossomed into a global financial force. With on-the-ground reporting  personal observations and richly drawn anecdotes  Kelly takes the story far from Wall Street and into companies controlled by private equity  examining how the business affects us as workers and taxpayers. With the presidential candidacy of former Bain Capital CEO Mitt Romney  and the industry's deepening influence on Main Street  understanding private equity and where it's headed is more important than ever. The New Tycoons offers a compelling examination of a massive  often overlooked  economic engine. You'll discover the untold stories of the most important firms and game-changing individuals that own everything. 				    	 					              See all Product description"

"Don't Lose Your Mind  Lose Your Weight Review Don't Lose your mind  Lose your weight by Rujuta Diwekar  the one behind Kareena Kapoor's marvellous figure is a refreshing read. Unlike preachy  regimental  tough and curtail some diets  the book offers realistic measures that can be adopted in order to stay healthy and fit. Don't count the calories  count whether you're fit is what the author vouches for. Narrating her interactions with different clients and people from all walks of life  she subtly conveys the message of how to eat right. The book explores the fad behind crash diets  disadvantages of having Sugarfree  eating in a relaxed manner  eating whole fruits - not cutting them retains their nutrients  eating according to one's genes and eating local produce and seasonal food. I was thrilled to read that having Paneer parantha is better than having Pizza. Rujuta also warns that people lost not only their weight to Atkins diet  but also their health. She suggests eating everything (which is what I love about this book)  but at the right time  right quantity and at the right intervals. Indulge in sweets once a week(don't eat them with a meal though !)  have home-made pakoras once a month(immediately after frying ) she says. She explains thru examples that processed food is harmful as it contains Transfats. I was dumbstruck when I read that including nuts  cheese and other dairy products in your daily diet is good for your health. Sticking to cooking in your mother's Iron pot  kadhai or tawa is good as adds Iron to your body. Sources of different Vitamins and their importance are mentioned in an interesting manner. Take for instance  Vitamin A supports our immune system and helps prevent cancer  Vitamin E protects the heart  Vitamin K helps in building healthy bones  Vitamin C is an antioxidant and Vitamin B helps metabolise Carbohydrates  aids digestion  improves nerve function and prevents Depression. Avoid waking up to Tea/Coffee  eat small meals frequently and eat dinner 2 hours before you sleep are her primary tips to the health-conscious person. Exercise at least 3 hours a week and remember that ""Exercise is a way to improve fitness  blood circulation and to love the body."" The book is well-structured  livened up with examples  diet charts  tips and much much more. So  go grab your copy too !! (or one for your partner !!) This book was gifted to me by my hubby and has made more aware of how to eat right and exercise regularly. Thanks Vikash (my hubby) and thanks Rujuta for coming up with such an interesting book !! --Aparna Chandra Jan 18  2013This book is all about altering your thinking about Dieting  and it works. This is not a ordinary diet book where they throw on you a diet chart  asks you to follow and loose weight. That never works because our culture is so diverse what people eat daily changes every 100 kms so a Mumbaikar making a diet chart will not work for guy living in Meerut U.P. He might be able to survive for a week or two but thats it then his genes will take over and he'll end up eating ghar ka bana mummy ke haath ka khana(in our families the amount of love is shown by the amount of ghee/chaunk/oil in our food). So what Rujuta does is tell us how does your digestion work a few tips (a lot actually) and her 4 principles of eating gives us a few ideas what should we prefer to eat (I hope there were some more) and even lets us eat Samosas Gulab Jamun Parathas Pizza etc(No this is not a typo this is actually a part of your diet)  the only thing what changes is WHEN you eat. She just alters our When and asks us to eat everything including Cheese. For 119 bucks I would definitely recommend this. Now that you have tried (and failed) all the dietings known to mankind just spend another 100 bucks and give this a shot. My final Verdict- Game Changer --Shikhar Sharma Oct 18  2011Rujuta manages to combine all the scientific knowledge that we need to know about the food we eat with a very humorous twist. There's also a bit of spirituality thrown in which makes it a unique read for me. Following the advice outlined in this book  I have been able to lose more than 12 kilos in 9 months and more importantly have not gained it back. I have changed my way of eating radically and at the same time eating the same food which I have eaten all my life. Thank you Rujuta for showing us a simple route on this lifelong quest :) --Krishna A Dec 13  2012 				    	 					 About the Author The author of Don't Lose Your Mind  Lose Your Weight  Rujuta Diwekar  won the Nutrition Award in the year 2010. She won this sought-after award from the Asian Institute of Gastroenterology. She received instant success with her first book  selling more than two lack books in four different languages. She is also the only nutritionist who received accreditation from the Sports Dieticians  which is based in Australia."

"Directorate S: The C.I.A. and America's Secret Wars in Afghanistan and Pakistan  2001–2016 Review Every assertion is carefully sourced and checked. This book is in the finest traditions of American investigative journalism. Coll is the thinking man's Michael Wolff. (Sherard Cowper-Coles The Times)A masterful and entertaining account ... the story is delivered with a literary prowess that has been absent in previous western accounts of America's longest running war (Rafia Zakaria Guardian)Spectacular ... Directorate S has a cast of characters that makes Bourne movies pale in comparison (Demetri Sevastopulo Financial Times)Impressively detailed  stylishly crafted and authoritative... as gloomy as it is compelling (Economist) 				    	 					 From the Inside Flap In the wake of the terrible shock of 9/11  the CIA scrambled to work out how to destroy Bin Laden and his associates. They had long familiarity with Afghanistan and had worked closely with the Taliban to defeat the Soviet Union there  now a tangle of assumptions  old contacts  favours and animosities from the time were reactivated. Superficially the invasion of Afghanistan was quick and efficient  but Bin Laden's successful escape - and a catastrophic failure to define the limits of NATO's mission in a tough  impoverished country the size of Texas - created a quagmire which lasted many years.Today we know that the war in Afghanistan would falter badly because of military hubris at the highest levels. But more than anything  as Steve Coll's remarkable new book makes painfully clear  it was doomed because of the failure of the United States to apprehend the motivations and intentions of 'Directorate S': a highly secretive arm of the Pakistan state  which had been covertly training and arming the Taliban for years as part of a wider competition for global influence - and which assumed that the USA and its allies would soon be leaving. Resuming the narrative of his Pulitzer Prize-winning Ghost Wars  Steve Coll tells for the first time a powerful  bitter story of a struggle of historic proportions  involving multiple secret intelligence agencies  a litany of incongruous strategies and tactics  and dozens of prominent players. Drawing on unsurpassed expertise and original research  it is a masterpiece of investigative journalism.              See all Product description"

The History of God CD: The 4 000 Year Quest About the Author Karen Armstrong  author  scholar  and journalist  is among the world's foremost commentators on religious history and culture. Her books include the bestselling A History of God and The Battle for God  as well as Buddha and Islam: A Short History.  From AudioFile Karen Armstrong's subtitle isn't quite accurate. This history of God doesn't just review how believers in each in the three major Western monotheistic religions conceptualized the Divine. Armstrong also explains how each faith influenced the others and how each related to philosophical  political  and scientific developments. Armstrong's tone is engaged  almost excited  communicating the importance of this topic  but balanced and fair. In this the delivery matches the text: Both are clear and accessible. The one weakness in this production is that it's an abridgment  so much is covered in a relatively short time that more explanation of the subtler points  and a slower pace  would have worked better.

"The Strange Death of Europe: Immigration  Identity  Islam Review This is a brilliant  important and profoundly depressing book. That it is written with Douglas Murray's usual literary elegance and waspish humour does not make it any less depressing. That Murray will be vilified for it by the liberals who have created the appalling mess he describes does not make it any less brilliant and important . Read it. (Rod Liddle  Sunday Times)His overall thesis  that a guilt-driven and exhausted Europe is playing fast and loose with its precious modern values by embracing migration on such a scale  is hard to refute. (Juliet Samuel  Telegraph)Every so often  something is published which slices through the fog of confusion  obfuscation and the sheer dishonesty of public debate to illuminate one key fact about the world. Such a work is Douglas Murray's tremendous and shattering book  The Strange Death of Europe. (Melanie Phillips  The Times)Breathtakingly gripping (Michael Gove  Standpoint)A cogent summary of how  over three decades or more  elites across western Europe turned a blind eye to the failures of integration and the rise of Islamism . Persuasive (The Times)This is a vitally important book  the contents of which should be known to everyone who can influence the course of events  at this critical time in the history of Europe. (Sir Roger Scruton)Douglas Murray glitters in the gloom. His pessimism about multiculturalism is so well constructed and written it is almost uplifting. Liberals will want to rebut him. I should warn them that they will need to argue harder than they have ever argued before. (Nick Cohen)Douglas Murray's introduction to this already destructive subject of Islamist hegemony is a distinguished attempt to clarify the origins of a storm. I found myself continually wishing that he wasn't making himself quite so clear. (Clive James)Douglas Murray writes so well that when he is wrong he is dangerous (Matthew Parris  Spectator)Whether one agrees with him or not Murray has made a valuable contribution to the global battle of ideas (Amir Taheri  Asharq al-Awsat) 				    	 					 Book Description A controversial and devastatingly honest depiction of the demise of Europe 				    	 					              See all Product description"

The book introduces the methods that acted as midwife at the birth of a science of consciousness…. Postulating that global availability of information is what we subjectively experience as a conscious state begets the question of why…. Answering such questions requires an information-theoretical account of what type of data  communicated within what system  gives rise to conscious experience in biological or artificial organisms. Dehaene’s well-written and well-sourced book avoids this  as this  as he opts to restrict it to behavioral and neuronal observables.”—Christof Koch  Science “Consciousness tomes have become a dime a dozen over the past decade or so  with every last researcher feeling the need to join the fray. But Stanislas Dehaene is one of the few at the top of the disciplines involved – philosophy  history  cognitive psychology  brain imaging  computer modelling – to add something new.”—New Scientist “An excellent teacher with a gift for vivid analogies  Dehaene writes that ‘consciousness is like the spokesperson in a large institution . . . with a staff of a hundred billion neurons’ issuing briefs that tell us what we need to know moment by moment. He then explains his and his colleagues’ groundbreaking theory about the “global neuronal workspace ” where information is made ‘available to the rest of the brain ’ wowing us with descriptions of our pyramidal neurons and their spiny dendrites and the discovery that each neuron ‘cares’ about such specific stimuli as ‘faces  hands  objects.’ A stunning delineation of the “exquisite biological machinery” that has made us an animal unlike any other.”—Booklist  starred review“A revealing and definitely not dumbed-down overview of what we know about consciousness.”—Kirkus Reviews“Stanislas Dehaene’s remarkable book is the best modern treatment of consciousness I have read to date. Dehaene  a world-class scientist  has pioneered the development of a set of experiments for studying consciousness that have revolutionized the field and given us the first direct approach to its biology. Simply stated this book is a tour de force. It opens up a whole new world of intellectual exploration for the general reader.”—Eric Kandel  author of In Search of Memory and The Age of Insight  and winner of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine  About the Author Stanislas Dehaene was trained as a mathematician and psychologist before becoming one of the world’s most active researchers on the cognitive neuroscience of language and number processing in the human brain.

"When Breath Becomes Air Review “I guarantee that finishing this book and then forgetting about it is simply not an option. . . . Part of this book’s tremendous impact comes from the obvious fact that its author was such a brilliant polymath. And part comes from the way he conveys what happened to him—passionately working and striving  deferring gratification  waiting to live  learning to die—so well. None of it is maudlin. Nothing is exaggerated. As he wrote to a friend: ‘It’s just tragic enough and just imaginable enough.’ And just important enough to be unmissable.”—Janet Maslin  The New York Times “Paul Kalanithi’s memoir  When Breath Becomes Air  written as he faced a terminal cancer diagnosis  is inherently sad. But it’s an emotional investment well worth making: a moving and thoughtful memoir of family  medicine and literature. It is  despite its grim undertone  accidentally inspiring.”—The Washington Post “Paul Kalanithi’s posthumous memoir  When Breath Becomes Air  possesses the gravity and wisdom of an ancient Greek tragedy. . . . [Kalanithi] delivers his chronicle in austere  beautiful prose. The book brims with insightful reflections on mortality that are especially poignant coming from a trained physician familiar with what lies ahead. . . . The narrative voice is so assured and powerful that you almost expect him to survive his own death and carry on describing what happened to his friends and family after he is gone.”—The Boston Globe “Devastating and spectacular . . . [Kalanithi] is so likeable  so relatable  and so humble  that you become immersed in his world and forget where it’s all heading.”—USA Today “It’s [Kalanithi’s] unsentimental approach that makes When Breath Becomes Air so original—and so devastating. . . . Its only fault is that the book  like his life  ends much too early.”—Entertainment Weekly“[When Breath Becomes Air] split my head open with its beauty.”—Cheryl Strayed“Rattling  heartbreaking  and ultimately beautiful  the too-young Dr. Kalanithi’s memoir is proof that the dying are the ones who have the most to teach us about life.”—Atul Gawande“Thanks to When Breath Becomes Air  those of us who never met Paul Kalanithi will both mourn his death and benefit from his life. This is one of a handful of books I consider to be a universal donor—I would recommend it to anyone  everyone.”—Ann Patchett “Dr. Kalanithi describes  clearly and simply  and entirely without self-pity  his journey from innocent medical student to professionally detached and all-powerful neurosurgeon to helpless patient  dying from cancer. Every doctor should read this book—written by a member of our own tribe  it helps us understand and overcome the barriers we all erect between ourselves and our patients as soon as we are out of medical school.”—Henry Marsh  author of Do No Harm: Stories of Life  Death  and Brain Surgery  About the Author Paul Kalanithi was a neurosurgeon and writer. He grew up in Kingman  Arizona  and graduated from Stanford University with a BA and MA in English literature and a BA in human biology. He earned an MPhil in history and philosophy of science and medicine from the University of Cambridge and graduated cum laude from the Yale School of Medicine  where he was inducted into the Alpha Omega Alpha national medical honor society. He returned to Stanford to complete his residency training in neurological surgery and a postdoctoral fellowship in neuroscience  during which he received the American Academy of Neurological Surgery’s highest award for research. He died in March 2015. He is survived by his large  loving family  including his wife  Lucy  and their daughter  Elizabeth Acadia. 				    	 					              See all Product description"

"Book on Acting: Improvisation Techniques for the Professional Actor in Film  Theater & Television Review Improvisation is essential to acting and Book is a terrific teacher. -- William Hurt  From the Publisher A new technique for improvising performances with scripted and memorized lines. The ability to improvise a skilled performance while speaking scripted and memorized lines is of paramount importance to actors working in todays film and television productions  which often allow very little if any rehearsal time. Through his innovative Improvisation Technique  Stephen Book shows the actor how to create a spontaneous performance by applying improvisation to traditional script-acting for film  theater  and television. Book on Acting begins with immediate training in how to improvise. Books fundamental principle of improvisation is ""Acting is doing  and there is always more to do."" The actor learns what to do to keep himself in a spontaneous improvisational state. This Improvisation Technique is then applied to exercises with scripted lines  developing sophisticated improvisation skills for enhancing character  emotions  conflict  and agreement as well as improving the actors audition process. Also included is a unique process for breaking down scripted scenes into improvisation choices. Book on Acting contains film and television scenes in which Book-coached actors  used his Improvisation Technique to create their performances. These scenes  showing the actors performance choices  demonstrate the use of Improvisation Technique in different genres of acting. Well-known theater and film scenes are included  as well as scenes from such TV shows as Melrose Place  Star Trek: Voyager  L.A. Law  Frasier  and The Practice. Books Improvisation Technique extends the work of Viola Spolin (author of Improvisation for the Theater). Book was Spolins student  assistant  representative  and her partner in the Spolin Theater Game Center in Hollywood  where he served as executive director and principal teacher in the 1970s.

"Equine Infectious Diseases Review ""Equine Infectious Diseases is a complete up-to-date review essential for both the general equine practitioner and the specialist  covering both common and rare infectious diseases of the horse  with an international collection of contributors from USA  Canada  United Kingdom  Germany  Denmark  Australia and South Africa.While this book is a complete and detailed review of infectious diseases in horses  with the latest information on diagnosis  treatment and control of infectious diseases  it is also easy to read  the information is clinically relevant for the practitioner and information is easily accessed. This book is highly recommended for all veterinarians involved in equine practice.""Cynthia Donnellan VBSc (hons) Mmedvet  April 2008EQUINE INFECTIOUS DISEASESAuthors: D C Sellon and M LongPublisher: SaundersThis is an extremely comprehensive and detailed reference book on infectious diseases of horses with contributions from many world renowned experts in their various fields. It covers both organ system infections and discussion of specific viral  bacterial  rickettsial  fungal and parasitic diseases and has a final section on the prevention and control of infectious diseases. Recognition  treatment and control of infectious diseases remains the cornerstone of clinical equine practice  never more so now climate change is leading to the spread of disease vectors and bringing diseases previously considered exotic to more temperate regions of the world.Inevitably  the book has a North American bias  as the editors are based at North American Universities and the majority of the contributors are based in North America. Nevertheless  this does not detract from its value as a reference book. The chapters are extremely well illustrated and include a wide variety of illustrations of clinical cases  pathological specimens and histological slides. There is extensive discussion of the laboratory diagnosis of each disease with detailed information on the biochemical characterisation of each organism. Detailed references are included on an easy to use CD-ROM.Unfortunately  given the rapidly changing nature of infectious diseases  some subjects are already out of date. For example  no mention is made of the recent Irish outbreak of Equine Infectious Anaemia and the unusual epidemiological features of this outbreak.This is an extremely comprehensive  well illustrated summary of equine infectious disease and I can thoroughly recommend it to all those who wish to obtain detailed summaries of the major equine diseases. The section on Prevention and Control of infectious diseases is particularly useful in illustrating the approach to diagnosis and control of infectious diseases  with detailed discussion of epidemiology  biosecurity and antimicrobial therapy.With the ever increasing international travel of horses and climate changes it has never been more important for equine veterinary surgeons to be alert to the possibilities of new and emerging diseases in the U.K. This book will provide an essential reference for all those wishing to be informed on both familiar and less familiar infectious diseases of horses.Reviewed by David Dugdale at Greenwood Ellis and Partners for EVJ 				    	 					 Review Prevent  diagnose  and treat equine infectious diseases with this comprehensive resource"

"The Brain's Way of Healing: Remarkable Discoveries and Recoveries from the Frontiers of Neuroplasticity Review #1 Globe and Mail Nonfiction Bestseller#1 Toronto Star Nonfiction Bestseller Praise for The Brain’s Way of Healing   “Brilliant and highly original. Neurology used to be considered a depressing discipline with patients often displaying fascinating but essentially untreatable symptoms and disabilities. Drawing on the last three decades of research  Doidge challenges this view  using vivid portraits of patients and their physicians. The book is a treasure trove of the author’s own deep insights and a clear bright light of optimism shines through every page.” —V. S. Ramachandran  MD  PhD  neurologist  neuroscientist  and author of The Tell-Tale Brain (W. W. Norton  2011)  Director  UCSD Center for Brain and Cognition “A tour de force. In one of the most riveting books on the human brain and its mystery powers ever written  Doidge addresses the role of alternative medical therapies to reset and re-sync the dynamic patterns of ‘energy in our brain  whit the ability to restore relatively normal health to those whose fate seems hopeless. . . . These are people that traditional medicine all but abandoned as . . . untreatable. But they were rescued. . . . It’s possible to start anywhere in the book and be mesmerized.” —Huffington Post“An exciting overview of powerful new neuroscience theories that connect mind  body  and soul . . . In this age of distraction and unnatural environments and actions—like staring at screens all day—brain science offers all kinds of useful techniques to care for our infinitely complex selves. Norman Doidge’s work is a Michelin Guide to this hopeful new trove of knowledge and insight.” —Boston Globe  USA  “Stunning . . . The Brain’s Way of Healing is another groundbreaking book by Norman Doidge.  His style keeps you going into the deep dark secrets of how the brain works. . . . [H]is reframing of remarkable treatments that I had categorized as gimmicky left me fascinated and humbled. He brings a whole new level of insight into the body  brain  mind connection that will impact any reader.” — John J. Ratey  MD  Clinical Associate Professor of Psychiatry  Harvard Medical School and author of Driven to Distraction   “Bold  remarkable . . . paradigm challenging. The Brain’s Way of Healing is brilliantly organized  scientifically documented  and a beautifully written narrative that captivates the reader  who is left with the profound message that the brain  similar to other organs  can heal.”  —Stephen W. Porges  PhD  Indiana University Bloomington and author of The Polyvagal Theory “Doidge’s book is filled with compelling stories about the power of ingenious technologies and disciplined awareness methods generated by innovators who transcended their own brain challenges  and who now use them to help others make radical improvements in conditions often deemed hopeless. It points to a future of remarkable and unprecedented brain healing.”  —Martha Herbert  MD  PhD  Neurologist  Harvard Medical School  and Massachusetts General Hospital  author of The Autism Revolution   “The Brain’s way of Healing is a stunner—the sort of book you want to read several times  not because it is difficult to understand  but because it opens up so many novel and startling avenues into our potential to heal. Norman Doidge enthralls us with a rich combination of lucidly explained brain research and pioneering new (and some not so new  but not widely known) approaches to recovery. With an eloquence reminiscent of Oliver Sacks  Doidge bolsters the latest advances in brain science with a series of extraordinary case histories of people for whom all hope seemed to be lost  but who healed as a result of great personal courage  and by changing the ways their bodies and brains processed sensations and movement. This hopeful book demonstrates that a variety of sensory inputs—light  sound  electricity  vibration  movement  and thought—can awaken the brain’s attention processors  and thereby allow even the most afflicted to (re)gain ownership of their lives.   —Bessel van der Kolk MD  Medical Director  the Trauma Center  Brookline MA  Professor of Psychiatry  Boston University School of Medicine  Author of The Body keeps the Score: Mind  Brain and Body in the healing of Trauma “The book offers real hope to individuals suffering from diverse chronic conditions. It shows in terms of graphic personal stories that we truly do not yet know the limits of what is possible in rehabilitation. The book also has a number of creative integrations of the data that will be of interest to neuroscientists.” —Edward Taub  Ph.D.  Behavioral Neuroscientist  University Professor University of Alabama at Birmingham  Director  UAB CI Therapy Research Group and Taub Training Clinic  “Everyone who has a brain could benefit from reading Doidge’s book.” —The Columbus Dispatch   “A vivid  robust and optimistic read . . . an essential addition to our growing understanding of the mind-brain-body connection. Doidge argues quite convincingly that when the brain is damaged or incompletely formed  whether from stroke  multiple sclerosis  traumatic brain injury  autism  ADHD or a host of other conditions  it’s entirely possible to “rewire” the circuits by training a different part of the brain to take over the task. . . . He's positively elegant in his crystalline explanations of brain science for a lay audience.” —Toronto Star  Canada    “This is a book of miracles: an absorbing compendium of unlikely recoveries from physical and mental ailments offers evidence that the brain can heal. Fascinating . . . brings to mind Oliver Sacks.” —Guardian    “Dazzling . . . In friendly vignettes reminiscent of Oliver Sacks’s case studies  Doidge chronicles the heroic efforts of patients with a wide variety of apparently intractable ailments  from chronic pain to multiple sclerosis. . . . Each of Doidge’s examples suggests tangible treatment ideas for patients who may have thought they were out of options. Doidge’s penchant for considering unconventional approaches to healing offers hope for all.”  —Bookpage  USA   “Beautifully written . . . inspiring . . . merging scientific information into timeless and fascinating personal stories . . . The Brain's Way of Healing grabs onto the reader at once and compels them to keep reading. This is an important and encouraging book.” —The Vancouver Sun  Canada   “Exhilarating science . . . In an era of ever-increasing medicalisation of the human mind  and the medication of it  the appeal of neuroplasticity outlined by Doidge is addictive. It is inspiring  page-turning stuff.” —Sunday Times  London“A fascinating study on brain science that shows the way to major therapeutic discoveries.” —Library Journal  About the Author Norman Doidge  M.D.  is a psychiatrist and psychoanalyst. He is on the research faculty at Columbia University’s Center for Psychoanalytic Training and Research in New York City and on the faculty of the University of Toronto’s department of psychiatry. His last book  The Brain that Changes Itself  was a New York Times bestseller with more than a million copies sold. He lives in Toronto. 				    	 					              See all Product description"

"A Champion's Mind: Lessons from a Life in Tennis Review “Consider this book Sampras’ 15th Grand Slam. A thoroughly compelling read that–apart from retracing a gilded sport career–really probes the ‘hard drive’ of a champion. It’s as if all the emotion and insight that Sampras sometimes seemed reluctant to express during his playing days comes spilling forth.”—Jon Wertheim  Senior Writer  Sports Illustrated and SI.com""As the title says  this is a remarkable look into a champion's mind  and maybe one of the best tennis memoirs ever. Pete captures the pressure a player feels once he's reached the top. He puts us next to him on the court  and we get a clear sense of what made him extraordinary: he was supremely determined  dedicated to learning the strengths and weaknesses of his opponents  and committed to never ever yielding a point easily. Pete wrote this book the way he plays tennis: full-out.""—Rod Laver“Even playing at a high level  it’s hard to know what the experience of winning–and trying to stay on top–is like for another competitor. We all react so differently to pressure  to the glow of the spotlight. It is brutally hard to stay grounded  and yet this wonderfully candid book shows that it was Pete’s rare ability to compartmentalize and draw strength from his family that allowed him to reach the sport’s pinnacle. Whether championships are in your past or just live in your dreams  you’ll learn a lot from Pete’s story.”—Monica Seles""Pete Sampras was always able to rise to the occasion  winning so many big matches at the biggest events.  This book provides the reader a glimpse into Pete's remarkable career and how he was able attain his vision of being the best player in the world.  We can all benefit from the insight he offers.""—Roger FedererFrom the Hardcover edition.

"50 Economics Classics (50 Classics) Review Something of a modern classic in its own right.The synopses in this book are fair  balanced  and about as good an introduction to the broad range of modern economic writing  along with a few classics  as one is likely to find.50 Economics Classics is a celebration of the large imaginative canvasses of the great economists. Butler-Bowdon's choices are broad  interdisciplinary and compellingly idiosyncratic. His chapters are not simply straight summaries of the chosen works  but thoughtful reflections on why we should care about this or that book and what its relevance is for us today. Butler-Bowdon's renderings are done so well that one might never bother going back to the original! Professional economists  students and general readers alike will find much here to delight in and many new byways to explore.This is not just a book for people who want to save time by reading one book instead of 50. [It] looks into some huge pieces of economic thought which even many important economists have browsed too swiftly. If you are not an economist  this book will teach you a lot. And if you are an economist  it will also teach you a lot.A fascinating and very timely book.A good starting point for someone new to economics wanting a general overview. Capturing the essence of a book in 3 pages is a difficult task. Tom Butler-Bowdon is obviously a very well-read person with this rare skill.I've read 50 Economics Classics cover to cover. It's a remarkable achievement and I wish I'd had it when doing A level economics.This embracing publication is not only a wonderful introduction  but a useful reminder of the subject for seasoned learners.Economics giants such as Adam Smith  Karl Marx and Milton Friedman feature heavily  but one of the book's big plus points for me is that it has room for more contemporary authors and ideas... the book is a well-written affair by an author obviously in full control of his subject.Distils the most influential economics books ever written. 				    	 					 Book Description The greatest economics books distilled in the latest volume of the bestselling 50 Classics series.

"Digital Minimalism: On Living Better with Less Technology Review As a presence on the page  Newport is exceptional in the realm of self-help authors (New York Times Book Review)Cal Newport speaks human truth to digital power. He calls out our enslavement to modern devices and calmly presents a better way to live and work (Julia Hobsbawm author of Fully Connected)This book is an urgent call to action for anyone serious about being in command of their own life (Ryan Holiday author of The Obstacle is the Way)Cal Newport has discovered a cure for the techno-exhaustion that plagues our always-on  digitally caffeinated culture (Joshua Fields Millburn The Minimalists)Cal Newport's Digital Minimalism is the best book I've read in some time about our fraught relationship with technology. If you're looking for a blueprint to guide you as you liberate yourself from the shackles of email  social networks  smartphones  and screens  let this book be your guide (Adam Alter author of Irresistible)You're not the user  you're the product. Hang up  log off  and tune in to a different way to be in the world. Bravo  Cal  smart advice for good people (Seth Godin author of This is Marketing)I hope that everyone who owns a mobile phone and has been wondering where their time goes gets a chance to absorb the ideas in this book. It's amazing how the same strategy can work for both financial success and mental well-being: Put more energy into what makes you happy  and ruthlessly strip away the things that don't (Pete Adeney aka Mr. Money Mustache)I challenge you not to devour this wonderful book in one sitting. I certainly did and I started applying Cal's ideas to my own life immediately (Greg McKeown author of Essentialism)Cal Newport's book is a refreshing antidote to the poisonous cycle of what's new? - what's new? that this digital  hyperconnected decade has seduced us into. Building on the economics of Henry David Thoreau  Cal's call for calmer waters  for meaningful and engaged interactions  is just what the world needs right now (Daniel J. Levitin author of The Organised Mind)Digital Minimalism is the Marie Kondo of mobile phones (Evening Standard) 				    	 					 From the Inside Flap Minimalism is the art of knowing how much is just enough. Digital minimalism applies this idea to our personal technology. It's the key to living a better and more focused life.In this timely and enlightening book  the bestselling author of Deep Work introduces a philosophy for technology use that has already improved countless lives. Digital minimalists are all around us. They're the calm  happy people who can hold long conversations without furtive glances at their phones. They can have fun without feeling the obsessive urge to document the experience. They stay informed about the news of the day but don't feel overwhelmed by it. They don't experience 'fear of missing out' because they already know which activities provide them with meaning and satisfaction.Now  Newport gives us a name for this quiet movement  and makes a persuasive case for its urgency in our tech-saturated world. Turning off notifications and observing a digital Sabbath doesn't go far enough in helping us take back control  and attempts to unplug completely are complicated by the demands of family  friends and work. What we need is a thoughtful method to decide what tools to use  for what purposes and under what conditions.Drawing on a diverse array of real-life examples  Newport identifies the common practices of digital minimalists and shows how they are rethinking their relationship to social media  rediscovering the pleasures of the offline world and reconnecting with their selves through regular periods of solitude. He then shares strategies for integrating these practices into your life  starting with a thirty-day 'digital declutter' process that has already helped thousands of people feel less overwhelmed and more in control.Technology is neither intrinsically good nor bad. The key is using it to support your goals and values  rather than letting it use you. This book shows the way.              See all Product description"

"The Complete Adventures of Feluda Vol. 1 Review Fanfeludastic --Indian Review of Books... taut  smart and visually charged ... There is no age bar for reading this collection --Mid-day... kaleidoscopic dance of images and remarkable powers of observation --Deccan Herald 				    	 					 About the Author Satyajit Ray was born on 2 May 1921 in Calcutta. After graduating from Presidency College  Calcutta  in 1940  he studied art at Rabindranath Tagore’s university  Shantiniketan. By 1943  Ray was back in Calcutta and had joined an advertising firm as a visualizer. He also started designing covers and illustrating books brought out by Signet Press. A deep interest in films led to his establishing the Calcutta Film Society in 1947. During a six-month trip to Europe  in 1950  Ray became a member of the London Film Club and managed to see ninety-nine films in only four-and-a-half months. In 1955  after overcoming innumerable difficulties  Satyajit Ray completed his first film  Pather Panchali  with financial assistance from the West Bengal government. The film was an award-winner at the Cannes Film Festival and established Ray as a director of international stature. Together with Aparajito (The Unvanquished  1956) and Apur Sansar (The World of Apu  1959)  it forms the Apu trilogy and perhaps constitutes Ray’s finest work. Ray’s other films include Jalsaghar (The Music Room  1958)  Charulata (1964)  Aranyer Din Ratri (Days and Nights in the Forest  1970)  Shatranj Ke Khilari (The Chess Players  1977)  Ghare Baire (The Home and the World  1984)  Ganashatru (Enemy of the People  1989)  Shakha Proshakha (Branches of a Tree  1990)  and Agantuk (The Stranger  1991). Ray also made several documentaries  including one on Tagore. In 1987  he made the documentary Sukumar Ray  to commemorate the birth centenary of his father  perhaps Bengal’s most famous writer of nonsense verse and children’s books. Satyajit Ray won numerous awards for his films. Both the British Federation of Film Societies and the Moscow Film Festival Committee named him one of the greatest directors of the second half of the twentieth century. In 1992  he was awarded the Oscar for Lifetime Achievement by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Science and  in the same year  was also honoured with the Bharat Ratna. Apart from being a film-maker  Satyajit Ray was a writer of repute. In 1961  he revived the children’s magazine  Sandesh  which his grandfather  Upendrakishore Ray  had started and to which his father used to contribute frequently. Satyajit Ray contributed numerous poems  stories and essays to Sandesh  and also published several books in Bengali  most of which became best-sellers. In 1978  Oxford University awarded him its D.Litt degree. Satyajit Ray died in Calcutta in April 1992."

"Men Are from Mars  Women Are from Venus: Practical Guide for Improving Communication and Getting What You Want in Your Relationships Review “Gray offers a Berlitz of the heart  a translation of that foreign language your spouse is speaking. And hearing.” (USA Today) 				    	 					 From the Back Cover Popular marriage counselor and seminar leader John Gray provides a unique  practical and proven way for men and women to communicate and relate better by acknowledging the differences between them. Once upon a time Martians and Venusians met  fell in love  and had happy relationships together because they respected and accepted their differences. Then they came to earth and amnesia set in: they forgot they were from different planets. Using this metaphor to illustrate the commonly occurring conflicts between men and women  Gray explains how these differences can come between the sexes and prohibit mutually fulfilling loving relationships. Based on years of successful counseling of couples  he gives advice on how to counteract these differences in communication styles  emotional needs and modes of behavior to promote a greater understanding between individual partners. Gray shows how men and women react differently in conversation and how their relationships are affected by male intimacy cycles (""get close""  ""back off"")  and female self-esteem fluctuations (""I'm okay""  ""I'm not okay""). He encourages readers to accept the other gender's particular way of expressing love  and helps men and women learn how to fulfill each other's emotional needs. With practical suggestions on how to reduce conflict  crucial information on how to interpret a partner's behavior and methods for preventing emotional ""trash from the past"" from invading new relationships  Men Are from Mars  Women Are from Venus is a valuable tool for couples who want to develop deeper and more satisfying relationships with their partners.

The Power of Now: A Guide to Spiritual Enlightenment From AudioFile The author shares ideas about personal integration with uncommon eloquence and a deep understanding of the human condition. Our true identity is in our moment-to-moment experiences rather than in our past or future. Concern about anything but the present is an unhealthy identification with the mind that can only cause pain and an illusion of control. Being totally aware of ourselves in each moment actually requires little effort or direction if we stop our thoughts long enough to find the pure consciousness that exists in the gaps between them. These ideas will be radical for most Westerners  but they are so smoothly elucidated that almost all seekers of inner truth will find something of value in the program.

In examining the relationship between human dimension and dining spaces  the areas of most concern to the designer are the clearances around the table and the number of people a table of a particular size can accommodate. The clearance between the edge of the table and the wall or any other physical obstruction must at the very least accommodate two elements: (1) the space occupied by the chair and (2) the maximum body breadth of a person of a larger body size as he circulates between the chair an the wall. In dealing with the space occupied by the chair  it should be noted that its position  relative to the edge of the table  will change several times during the course of a meal. Towards the end of a meal  perhaps while the person is engaged in informal conversation or in an effort to change body posture  the chair may be extended farther from the table. As a person leaves the table  the chair may be located even farther away. Comfortable clearance should assume the chair to be at its farthest distance from the table."

The tale concerns an old fisherman in a Cuban village who  after an especially bad fishing season  sets out in his skiff  determined to bring in a big fish. By noon  the old man hooks a great marlin  but the powerful fish drags the skiff out to sea for two days. Challenged by starvation  injury  a school of sharks  and this great  noble fish  the old man struggles to survive. Without even trying to put on an accent  Sutherland catches the cadence and intonation of Cuba as well as the weary determination of the old man.

"The Humanities in Contemporary Chinese Contexts (The Humanities in Asia) From the Back Cover This book brings together the perspectives of eminent and emerging scholars on contemporary issues relevant to the practice  pedagogy and institutionalization of the humanities in the three Chinese contexts of Hong Kong  Taiwan  and mainland China. It addresses the need to investigate how humanities discussions  often exclusively drawn from  and grounded in  western contexts  are today being played out in these three places. The humanities in contemporary Chinese contexts may have different social and pedagogical roles  and a consideration of them will enable people to moderate  and perhaps even refute  claims made in the recent (re)readings of the humanities. As Asian universities rise in the global rankings and as east-west university collaborations and partnerships become more common  it is important that the nature  practice and institutionalization of the humanities in Hong Kong  Taiwan  and mainland China are explored and described for English readers. Exploring new perspectives arising from an examination of the humanities in these places  this volume aims neither to establish a position of polarity  which would pit western sites against Chinese ones  nor to argue for universal sameness. Rather  the goal is to find nuanced correspondences and differences between these various backgrounds  so that there is a greater understanding of the specificities of Chinese contexts. This will help shed light not only on the contexts in question  but also potentially on how to rearticulate the importance of the humanities in general  creating an intercultural dialogue focused on the humanities. As the global university strives to move the different traditions of learning closer together through international rankings  rubrics  and shared research agendas  it is important that we explore these locations of potential cultural exchange.

There are few themes as demanding as the history of Jerusalem...tautly gripping...a book with its gaze fixed on the stars [but] also with its feet firmly in the gutter... A heavenly city Jerusalem may be  but it is also a relentlessly terrestrial one. The achievement of this marvellous book is to fuse them into one biography.as one turns the pages of Simon Sebag Montefiore's absorbing book...[one] becomes gripped by the rich  pungent detail of the lives of Jerusalem's rulers and the ruled. Montefiore has a great novelist's eye for detail  a great journalist's nose for human frailty  and a great historian's touch... judicious  nuanced  balanced and sensitive... when a history is written this way one can never have too much.Outstanding  superbly objective  elegantly written and highly entertainingSimon Sebag Montefiore's history of Jerusalem is a labour of love and scholarship... a considerable achievement... he has a wonderful ear for the absurdities and adventurers of the past... totally gripping... vivid compelling  engaged  engrossing  knowledgeableCompelling and thought-provoking...Working on an immense chronological and thematic canvas Sebag Montefiore does his subject more than justice. He narrates the terrible history of Jerusalem vividly and graphically... fascinating but ghastly.Montefiore's book  packed with fascinating and often grisly detail  is a gripping account of war  betrayal  rape  massacre  sadistic torture  fanaticism  feuds  persecution  corruption  hypocrisy and spirituality...Montefiore's narrative is remarkably objective...A reliable and compelling accountmasterly  vastly entertaining and timely... Sebag Montefiore has an unerring eye for the vivid detail to illustrate his point and the telling quote to place it in context... a compelling narrative and an important book.Jerusalem is an extraordinary achievement  written with imagination and energy that threatens to mesmerize and exhaust the reader at the same time...the resulting impression is of a unique borderline personality  with an irrepressible capacity for love and hatred  an aptitude for poetry  prophecy and the sacred  with no lack of the grotesquely profane...Read this book.To write a ""biography"" of Jerusalem is a formidable undertaking. Simon Sebag Montefiore has risen to the challenge. His book can be commended to anyone who is planning a trip to Jerusalem  or who wants background on the Palestinian question - or who just enjoys a good read.

"Cosmos Amazon.com Review Cosmos was the first science TV blockbuster  and Carl Sagan was its (human) star. By the time of Sagan's death in 1996  the series had been seen by half a billion people  Sagan was perhaps the best-known scientist on the planet. Explaining how the series came about  Sagan recalled: I was positive from my own experience that an enormous global interest exists in the exploration of the planets and in many kindred scientific topics--the origin of life  the Earth  and the Cosmos  the search for extraterrestrial intelligence  our connection with the universe. And I was certain that this interest could be excited through that most powerful communications medium  television. Sagan's own interest and enthusiasm for the universe were so vivid and infectious  his screen presence so engaging  that viewers and readers couldn't help but be caught up in his vision. From stars in their ""billions and billions"" to the amino acids in the primordial ocean  Sagan communicated a feeling for science as a process of discovery. Inevitably  some of the science in Cosmos has been outdated in the years since 1980--but Sagan's sense of wonder is ageless. --Mary Ellen Curtin  Review “Magnificent . . . With a lyrical literary style  and a range that touches almost all aspects of human knowledge  Cosmos often seems too good to be true.”—The Plain Dealer“Sagan is an astronomer with one eye on the stars  another on history  and a third—his mind’s—on the human condition.”—Newsday“Brilliant in its scope and provocative in its suggestions . . . shimmers with a sense of wonder.”—The Miami Herald“Sagan dazzles the mind with the miracle of our survival  framed by the stately galaxies of space.”—Cosmopolitan“Enticing . . . iridescent . . . imaginatively illustrated.”—The New York Times Book Review               See all Product description"

"Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions (Dover Thrift Editions) Review Western Mail Nice review in the Western Mail Series --Western Mail 				    	 					 About the Author Fifty Years in the Flatland2012 will mark the 50th anniversary in print with Dover of one of the most significant and influential books of the past century and a half. The mathematical  satirical  and religious allegory Flatland by a little-known but immensely prolific Victorian English schoolmaster and theologian Edwin Abbott Abbott  was first published anonymously in England in 1884 — Abbott wrote it under the name ""A Square."" The unique geometrical romance which is Flatland posited a world and its inhabitants that exist in only two dimensions and forces the reader captivated by the originality of this central idea to think deeply about the meaning of such a world. Generations of readers and students swept into the romance and fascination of geometry and other branches of mathematics and philosophy owe their introduction to this world to Flatland  which continues to entertain and stimulate new readers today  still going strong 126 years after the first edition was launched. Abbott revised the text somewhat for a second edition published just a few months after the first. Dover's 1952 edition was the first American reprinting of the amended second English edition and was published with a new Introduction by physicist Banesh Hoffmann. From the Book:""I CALL our world Flatland  not because we call it so  but to make its nature clearer to you  my happy readers  who are privileged to live in Space. Imagine a vast sheet of paper on which straight Lines  Triangles  Squares  Pentagons  Hexagons  and other figures  instead of remaining fixed in their places  move freely about  on or in the surface  but without the power of rising above or sinking below it  very much like shadows — only hard and with luminous edges — and you will then have a pretty correct notion of my country and countrymen. Alas  a few years ago  I should have said 'my universe': but now my mind has been opened to higher views of things."""

Money Wise: The Aam Aadmi's Guide to Wealth and Financial Freedom About the Author Sharath Komarraju lives in Bengaluru  surrounded by an ever-swelling collection of books. He began his professional life as a software engineer  but has now renounced it all in favour of a writing desk and a word processor. (He's happy to report that his head has stayed above water so far  though he's flapping like crazy underneath.)

His best known work is The Winds of Hastinapur  the first book in a series that attempts to tell the Mahabharata story from the viewpoints of all the prominent women characters. Sharath loves chocolates but can't have them because they make him fat. He loves cats but can't keep them because he's allergic to fur. For these two reasons he's almost always in a state of restless discontent  some of which he tries to dispel by writing stories. On occasion he succeeds. Money Wise is his first attempt at non-fiction.

"Christianity: The First Three Thousand Years Review ""A landmark contribution ... It is difficult to imagine a more comprehensive and surprisingly accessible volume than MacCulloch's.""  -Jon Meacham  The New York Times Book Review  ""A well-informed and - bless the man - witty narrative guaranteed to please and at the same time displease every single reader  if hardly in identical measure.... The author's prose style is fluent  well-judged and wholly free of cant ... You will shut this large book with gratitude for a long and stimulating journey.""  -The Washington Times  ""A prodigious  thrilling  masterclass of a history book. MacCulloch is to be congratulated for his accessible handling of so much complex  difficult material ... He keeps the reader engaged with wit and choice anecdotes and throughout the entire book he retains his own distinctive  slightly irreverent perspective  and an unerring instinct for when to go from macro to micro history.""  -John Cornwell  Financial Times  ""He brings an insider's wit to tracing the fate of official Christianity in an age of doubt  and to addressing modern surges of zeal  from Mormons to Pentecostals.""  -Economist  ""A triumphantly executed achievement. This book is a landmark in its field  astonishing in its range  compulsively readable  full of insight even for the most jaded professional and of illumination for the interested general reader. It will have few  if any  rivals in the English language.""  -Rowan Williams  Archbishop of Canterbury  ""Christianity is a tour de force: it has enormous range  is gracefully and wittily written  and from page one holds the attention. Everyone who reads it will learn things they didn't know.""  -Eamon Duffy  author of Saints and Sinners  ""The great strength of the book is that it covers  in sufficient but not oppressive detail  huge areas of Christian history which are dealt with cursorily in traditional accounts of the subject and are unfamiliar to most English-speaking readers ... His analysis of why Christianity has taken root in Korea but made such a hash in India is perceptive and his account of the nineteenth-century missions in Africa and the Pacific is first-rate and full of insight.""  -Paul Johnson  author of The Quest for God  About the Author Diarmaid MacCulloch is a fellow of St. Cross College  Oxford  and professor of the history of the church at Oxford University.

I read the last fifty pages with white knuckles  and the last twenty-five with tears in my eyes. History  sports  human interest  weather  suspense  design  physics  oppression and inspiration -- The Boats in the Boat has it all and Brown does full justice to his terrific material.  This is Chariots of Fire with oars.”--David Laskin  author of The Children's Blizzard  and  The Long Way Home“A lovingly crafted saga of sweat and idealism that raised goosebumps from the first page.

The Psychopathology of Everyday Life 
"The Tender Bar Amazon.com Review ""Long before it legally served me  the bar saved me "" asserts J.R. Moehringer  and his compelling memoir The Tender Bar is the story of how and why. A Pulitzer-Prize winning writer for the Los Angeles Times  Moehringer grew up fatherless in pub-heavy Manhasset  New York  in a ramshackle house crammed with cousins and ruled by an eccentric  unkind grandfather. Desperate for a paternal figure  he turns first to his father  a DJ whom he can only access via the radio (Moehringer calls him The Voice and pictures him as ""talking smoke""). When The Voice suddenly disappears from the airwaves  Moehringer turns to his hairless Uncle Charlie  and subsequently  Uncle Charlie's place of employment--a bar called Dickens that soon takes center stage. While Moehringer may occasionally resort to an overwrought metaphor (the footsteps of his family sound like ""storm troopers on stilts"")  his writing moves at a quick clip and his tale of a dysfunctional but tightly knit community is warmly told. ""While I fear that we're drawn to what abandons us  and to what seems most likely to abandon us  in the end I believe we're defined by what embraces us "" Moehringer says  and his story makes us believe it. --Brangien Davis  From The New Yorker In the mid-seventies  Moehringer  aged nine  first entered Dickens  a smoky Long Island pub. Through the next decades it became  variously  his hideout  ""holy place "" surrogate father  and ""security blanket."" But  perhaps as a result of his reverence for the place-and despite his assurances that he can accurately recall drunken conversations long past-scenes there often feel contrived and mawkish. The stronger episodes in this memoir  such as an endearing series of failures while working as a Times copyboy  take place away from Dickens's hazy influence. Revering a bar had other dangers  too  Moehringer eventually becomes unhappy with his drinking habits and decides that ""growing up"" means ""sobering up."" The bar had started to seem like a ""submarine trapped on the ocean floor.""  Copyright © 2005 The New Yorker               See all Product description"

"Green Hills of Africa: The Hemingway Library Edition Review ""[An] account of a hunting safari on the Serengeti Plains  a chronicle of adventure and a literary challenge Hemingway set up for himself. Anticipating by decades Truman Capote's 'nonfiction novel ' the classic 'In Cold Blood ' Hemingway wanted to prove that 'an absolutely true book' can 'compete with a work of the imagination.'"" (Hillel Italie  Associated Press)“[Hemingway’s wife  Pauline’s] engaging  laconic observations offer yet another lens through which to witness Hemingway at large in the world  while also helping the reader gauge how much  or how little  Hemingway reshaped the reality of his experiences in order to express  to his own satisfaction  his fondness for the hunt  his affinity for the natural world  and his abiding love of ‘the dark continent’ itself....With its journal entries  an insightful foreword  and a moving introduction by Hemingway’s sons  and some charming ‘letters from Africa’ that Hemingway published in Esquire…the reissue of this book is an opportunity  a reminder  to dive in again to a title we probably haven’t thought about for years….Encountering the book again after all these years  it’s hard not to marvel  page after page  at Hemingway’s singular gift for pure  descriptive prose.” (The Daily Beast)“The true joy lies in reading in Hemingway’s prose again: precise  lyrical  unwinding in long sentences  suggesting more than it reveals  sumptuous in its descriptions of the valleys  ravines  salt-licks  hills and forests of his beloved Africa.

"Alibaba: The House that Jack Ma Built Review “Anybody who thinks the Chinese just copy or steal technology from the West should read this book and think again. Jack Ma is part Bill Gates  part Steve Jobs  part Larry Page  part Sergei Brin  and part Mark Zuckerberg all rolled into one.” (Sir Martin Sorrell  CEO of WPP)“Useful  business-minded reporting on an unconventional corporate magnate  containing both corporate and human-interest perspectives.” (Kirkus Reviews)“This absorbing and well-written portrayal of Ma’s character  and his role in Alibaba’s development will appeal to a wide range of readers.” (Library Journal)“A clean and compelling narrative…[Clark] tells the story with flair.” (Wall Street Journal)“A fascinating new book.” (The Economist)“A must-read for anyone hoping to navigate China’s new economy”. (Financial Times) 				    	 					 From the Back Cover An engrossing  insider’s account of how a teacher built one of the world’s most valuable companies—rivaling Walmart and Amazon—and forever reshaped the global economyIn just a decade and a half  Jack Ma  a man from modest beginnings who started out as an English teacher  founded Alibaba and built it into one of the world’s largest companies  an e-commerce empire on which hundreds of millions of Chinese consumers depend. In 2014  Alibaba’s $25 billion IPO was the largest global IPO in history. A Rockefeller of his time  who is courted by CEOs and presidents around the world  Jack is an icon for China’s booming private sector and the gatekeeper to hundreds of millions of middle-class consumers. Duncan Clark first met Jack in 1999 in the small apartment where Jack founded Alibaba. Granted unprecedented access to a wealth of new material  including exclusive interviews  Clark draws on his own experience as an early adviser to Alibaba as well as his two decades in China chronicling the Internet’s impact on the country to create an authoritative  compelling narrative account of Alibaba’s rise.How did Jack overcome his humble origins and early failures to achieve massive success with Alibaba? How did he outsmart rival entrepreneurs from both China and Silicon Valley? Can Alibaba maintain its 80 percent market share? As it forges ahead into finance and entertainment  are there limits to Alibaba’s ambitions? How does the Chinese government view its rise? Will Alibaba expand farther overseas  including into the United States?Clark tells Alibaba’s tale in the context of China’s momentous economic and social changes  illuminating an unlikely corporate titan as never before.Advance Praise For Alibaba“Anybody who thinks the Chinese just copy or steal technology from the West should read this book and think again.

"The Theory of Everything Review Stephen Hawking's The Theory of Everything is a short book that can act as an introduction to the subjects of cosmology raised by modern science  but the book is only that  I preferred his Brief History of Time to this work because it was longer  more detailed  and covered more ground. If you are looking for a very basic introduction to the current thinking of astrophysicists  this is a good book  if you really want to wrestle with the subject at length  you should buy a Brief History of Time  or one of Paul Davies works  such as About Time. If you are looking for a good lecture series on physics  Richard Feynman's Six Easy Pieces and its sequel  Six Not So Easy Pieces is really the finest of this genre. That being said  the book does a good job in outlining the basic subject matter  discussing the development of the Big Bang theory  and the implications of both the general theory of relativity and quantum physics on the formation of the universe. Hawking is at his best when discussing singularities -- the points of the universe  such as black holes  where the laws of physics break down. --By D. W. Casey on June 27  2002This is a collection of seven related lectures by Hawking originally published in 1996 under the title  The Cambridge Lectures: Life Works. He does not cover as much ground here as in did in A Brief History of Time  but what he does cover he does so in a charming and engaging style. There are some few statements here that could be interpreted as less than modest--although not by me--and a mistaken prediction or two  which may be a reason that Hawking is not pleased with this book's publication. He might also object to the title  since neither a ""Theory of Everything"" nor a conclusive answer to the origin and fate of the universe are presented. However  Hawking does address these questions  and his expression is interesting to read and has the agreeable characteristic of being laconic. There are no equations in the book  no mathematics as such  and everything is explained in language that would be intelligible to a high school student. There are the usual droll Hawking jokes about God and His intentions  facetious  epigram-like understatements (I have done a lot of work on black holes  and it would all be wasted if it turned out that black holes do not exist. p. 66) and witty asides about the convergence of politics on physics  as when he mentions a particle accelerator the size of the Solar System that ""would not be funded under current economic conditions."" --By Dennis Littrell on March 23  2003this is one of the most interesting book . hawking has explained the whole universe very briefly . the book explains following things deeply *ideas about universe *expanding universe *black holes *origin and fate of universe *the direction of time * the theory of everything the book explains everything from beginning to the end of universe. it shows the interaction between science and natural powers. science lovers it will lead ur knowledge to a next level --By Shiva Thakur on 30 Sep 2012 				    	 					 About the Author Stephen Hawking is Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge and author of A Brief History of Time which was an international bestseller. His other books for the general reader include A Briefer History of Time  the essay collection Black Holes and Baby Universe and The Universe in a Nutshell. In 1963  Hawking contracted motor neurone disease and was given two years to live. Yet he went on to Cambridge to become a brilliant researcher and Professorial Fellow at Gonville and Caius College. Since 1979 he has held the post of Lucasian Professor at Cambridge  the chair held by Isaac Newton in 1663. Professor Hawking has over a dozen honorary degrees and was awarded the CBE in 1982. He is a fellow of the Royal Society and a Member of the US National Academy of Science. Stephen Hawking is regarded as one of the most brilliant theoretical physicists since Einstein."

"21 Lessons for the 21st Century Review “The human mind wants to worry. This is not necessarily a bad thing—after all  if a bear is stalking you  worrying about it may well save your life. Although most of us don’t need to lose too much sleep over bears these days  modern life does present plenty of other reasons for concern: terrorism  climate change  the rise of A.I.  encroachments on our privacy  even the apparent decline of international cooperation. In his fascinating new book  21 Lessons for the 21st Century  the historian Yuval Noah Harari creates a useful framework for confronting these fears. While his previous best sellers  Sapiens and Homo Deus  covered the past and future respectively  his new book is all about the present. The trick for putting an end to our anxieties  he suggests  is not to stop worrying. It’s to know which things to worry about  and how much to worry about them. . . . Harari is such a stimulating writer that even when I disagreed  I wanted to keep reading and thinking. . . . [Harari] has teed up a crucial global conversation about how to take on the problems of the twenty-first century.”—Bill Gates  The New York Times Book Review“If there were such a thing as a required instruction manual for politicians and thought leaders  Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari’s 21 Lessons for the 21st Century would deserve serious consideration. In this collection of provocative essays  Harari  author of the critically praised Sapiens and Homo Deus  tackles a daunting array of issues  endeavoring to answer a persistent question: ‘What is happening in the world today  and what is the deep meaning of these events?’ . . . Harari makes a passionate argument for reshaping our educational systems and replacing our current emphasis on quickly outdated substantive knowledge with the ‘four Cs’—critical thinking  communication  collaboration and creativity. . . . Thoughtful readers will find 21 Lessons for the 21st Century to be a mind-expanding experience.”—BookPage (top pick) “A sobering and tough-minded perspective on bewildering new vistas.”—Booklist (starred review)  “Magnificently combining historical  scientific  political  and philosophical perspectives  Harari . . . explores twenty-one of what he considers to be today’s ‘greatest challenges.’ Despite the title’s reference to ‘lessons ’ his tone is not prescriptive but exploratory  seeking to provoke debate without offering definitive solutions. . . . Within this broad construct  Harari discusses many pressing issues  including problems associated with liberal democracy  nationalism  immigration  and religion. This well-informed and searching book is one to be savored and widely discussed.”—Publishers Weekly (starred review) “A highly instructive exploration of ‘current affairs and . . . the immediate future of human societies.’ Having produced an international bestseller about human origins and avoided the sophomore jinx writing about our destiny  Harari proves that he has not lost his touch  casting a brilliantly insightful eye on today’s myriad crises  from Trump to terrorism  Brexit to big data. . . . [In] twenty-one painfully astute essays  he delivers his take on where our increasingly ‘post-truth’ world is headed. Human ingenuity  which enables us to control the outside world  may soon re-engineer our insides  extend life  and guide our thoughts. Science-fiction movies get the future wrong  if only because they have happy endings. Most readers will find Harari’s narrative deliciously reasonable  including his explanation of the stories (not actually true but rational) of those who elect dictators  populists  and nationalists. His remedies for wildly disruptive technology (biotech  infotech) and its consequences (climate change  mass unemployment) ring true  provided nations act with more good sense than they have shown throughout history. Harari delivers yet another tour de force.”—Kirkus Reviews (starred review)  About the Author Born in Haifa  Israel  in 1976  YUVAL NOAH HARARI received his PhD from the University of Oxford in 2002  and is currently a lecturer at the Department of History  the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Published in 2014  Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind has become an international hit and is published in nearly 40 languages worldwide. It was listed on the Sunday Times bestseller list for over six months in paperback  and was a New York Times top 10 bestseller. In 2016  Harari published Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow  which was also a widely hailed international bestseller. He lectures around the world on the topics explored in his books and articles  and has written for newspapers such as the Guardian  Financial Times  The Times and the Wall Street Journal. He also offers his knowledge and time to various organizations and audiences on a voluntary basis. 				    	 					              See all Product description"

All rights reserved. 1 TWENTY YEARS LATER PARIS  LE MERIDIeN MONTPARNASSE HOTEL MONDAY  JUNE 8  1992  1545H The white Jeep Renegade hurtled down A-22 on its way to Paris. The driver was alone in the vehicle. He stopped twice  to buy food from a vending machine and gas from a pump. Five hours later  his surveillance tail almost lost him in the swirling rush-hour traffic of a Paris afternoon. On Rue du Commandant Mouchotte the trackers watched the new Renegade with the German plates  B-585X  make a sudden right turn. The driver of the surveillance car floored the accelerator and caught a glimpse of the Jeep as it dropped into the shadows of an underground parking garage. A quick look at the building explained the unexpected move: the garage belonged to the Le Méridien Montparnasse Hotel  an old  quality establishment in the heart of the upscale Montparnasse district  with over nine hundred rooms and suites  and a reputation for discretion. The visitor took the elevator to reception on the first floor. He registered under a pseudonym  paid cash  and went straight up to Room 2541 with a small suitcase in his hand. The hotel guest was Atef Bseiso  a round-faced  elegantly dressed forty-four-year-old Palestinian who had been living in Tunis for the last ten years. He was the Palestine Liberation Organization-the PLO-liaison officer  working with  among others  the French internal security service  the Direction de la Surveillance du Territoire (DST). He was considered a rising star in his organization. His good relations with European intelligence agencies were  in large part  a product of his personal charm and charisma. Bseiso was drained from the drive-he had covered the six-hundred-mile journey in nine hours flat. Despite his fatigue and the alluring pull of the room's king-size bed  he went to the phone. Bseiso did not want to pass his only night in Paris with a remote control in his hand. He took out an address book and dialed the number of a PLO bodyguard. In Tunis  Bseiso felt safe  in Europe  he feared the Israelis. He had a list of names and numbers of men  frequently unarmed  who would accompany senior PLO officials in Europe to give them a sense of security. He told the man he'd be going out to dinner. The bodyguard offered to pick Bseiso up at the hotel. ""I've driven enough for today "" Bseiso said. ""Let's say nine at the entrance to the hotel. A tout à l'heure."" He showered and got dressed. Shabtai Shavit  the head of Israel's Institute for Intelligence and Special Operations  the Mossad  received a brief message in the operation's war room  located in a safe house in the 11th Arrondissement: ""He's in the Méridien Montparnasse. We're getting ready."" Shavit leaned back in his chair. The operation was in high gear. Shavit  in his early fifties  had run the Mossad for the past three years  and was well acquainted with undercover operations. He had served for six years as commander of the Mossad's Caesarea unit  which was charged with special operations and with running undercover Mossad combatants in enemy territory. He was in Paris on a borrowed identity: a different name was on the passport in the pocket of his blazer. None of his peers in the French secret service  or any other branch of the French intelligence services  knew he was in the country. His gut told him the mission would go well. He had complete confidence in the professionalism of Caesarea's combatants. Ilan C  Caesarea's intelligence collection officer  placed the thirty-by-forty-centimeter pictures of the facade of the Méridien Montparnasse Hotel on a table in another room in the Mossad safe house. The new pictures had been shot from a variety of angles and included the streets surrounding the hotel. The surveillance team had taken them as soon as Bseiso checked in. The operational plans  drawn up in advance by Caesarea officers  took a number of hotels into consideration  primarily the Méridien Etoile  an elegant hotel situated a few steps from the Champs-Elysées-but not the Méridien Montparnasse. Bseiso's unexpected choice forced them to revise their plans accordingly. The work was done quickly and efficiently. In less than an hour a new plan was brought before Shavit. Time was tight  and Shavit  never garrulous under even the most relaxed circumstances  kept it brief. He asked Caesarea's commander and the head of the assassination squad a few questions about the operation. He honed a few key points  and then  satisfied  approved the mission. The surveillance team had followed Bseiso for three days. They tracked him from the moment he arrived in Berlin  his meetings with German intelligence officers of the Bundesamt für Verfassungsschutz (BfV)  the purchase of the Jeep  his sprint to Paris. A half-dozen combatants  two cars  and two motorcycles comprised the surveillance team. Throughout  none of the operation's planners at Caesarea had any idea where Bseiso would stay. Would he choose the apartment of a friend  a flat set up by the DST  or a plush hotel room  courtesy of the kingly budget of Fatah  the largest faction of the PLO? Now they knew where they had to act. The operation needed to go into full swing immediately  as Bseiso  a notoriously reluctant traveler  might well spend only one night in Paris. Perhaps the following day  after meeting a colleague from the DST  he would return home  and the opportunity that had presented itself would be gone  possibly forever. Intelligence reports showed that Bseiso  whose job demanded frequent travel  tried to stay in Tunis as much as possible. When he did leave  he flew  a mode of travel not so susceptible to Israeli attack. Planes go directly from point A to point B. The traveler is never alone. People in cars meander  stop for gas  and spend the night at hotels. Bseiso  it turned out  was in fact planning to leave the following evening. He would drive to Marseilles  put the Jeep on a ferry to Tunis  and surprise his wife  Dima  and their three children with the new car. The Israelis waited in ambush outside the hotel. They assumed Bseiso would go out for dinner. When he returned  tired and contented  they would act. The late hours of the night  when the streets are quiet and empty  were always best for covert operations. The final decision would be in the hands of the two assassins  ""Tom"" and ""Frank."" The point man  Tom  would pull the trigger. Up until the last instant  he would have the authority to call off the operation: he would raise his weapon only when certain that his team would emerge unscathed. Atef Bseiso was a target because of the role he played in the slaughter of eleven Israeli Olympians in Munich  in 1972  almost twenty years prior. Shabtai Shavit wanted him to pay the price for participating in the killings. Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir authorized the mission and gave it his blessing. The state of Israel was on the verge of closing its case against another one of the ""bastards "" as they were known in the Mossad  who took part in the Munich Massacre. Bseiso did go out to dinner. The Caesarea surveillance team shadowed him  undetected  the whole time. They checked that he wasn't being guarded by his DST hosts. Bseiso  his bodyguard  and an unidentified Lebanese woman spent a pleasant night at a Hippopotamus Grill chain restaurant. It was after midnight when Bseiso picked up the tab and went back to the Jeep. He sat in the back  his bodyguard drove  and his friend sat in the front seat. They had a very loud  animated conversation in Arabic. A short drive brought them to the entrance of the Méridien Montparnasse. The Rue du Commandant Mouchotte was quiet  few cars passed by. Bseiso got out and said goodbye to his friends. He took one step back  preparing to move in the direction of the hotel. A few seconds later  two young men approached him. Their walk was loose  casual. Tom  the point man  raised his hand and pulled the trigger. The Beretta 0.22 issued its shots in silence  the retorts muzzled by a silencer. The three bullets hit Bseiso in the head. He fell on the spot  next to his friend's car  his final inhalation a gurgle. The hot cartridges were caught  along with the clues they held  in a sturdy cloth bag attached to the pistol. Within seconds  the assassin and his backup were rapidly retreating down the street. ""Abie "" the commander of the squad  waited for them near the corner  150 yards away. He watched them cross to the other side of Avenue du Maine and  from the other side of the street  at a more casual pace  watched their backs. This standard procedure was meant to thwart a mishap during the escape phase of a mission-a highly unlikely scenario  since it takes bystanders many long seconds  if not minutes  to realize that an assassination has just taken place. Nonetheless  the possibility couldn't be ignored. Within twenty seconds the point man and his number two were at the corner of a one-way street. According to Mossad procedure  the getaway car always waits two 90-degree turns from the scene of an operation. The pair made a left onto Rue Vandamme  where the waiting car had kept its motor running. Abie suddenly noticed two figures coming after his men. They were breathing heavily and speaking animatedly. This was a fast-approaching threat  they needed to be stopped. They could not be allowed to turn the corner and see the escape vehicle  or  even worse  commit the license plate to memory. Abie started toward them  his quick pace authoritative and threatening. When he was within fifteen feet of the pair he pulled out his Beretta. Holding it in front of their faces  he shouted: ""Stop!"" The weapon froze them in their tracks. They put their hands in the air  stumbled backwa..."

"India's Wars: A Military History  1947-1971 Review ""This book is a good introduction to the subject. It is generally quite detailed when it comes to the IAF.... The author has a definite political and ideological agenda [and] the details are accurate.... Well worth a read."" --Brown Pundits ""India's Wars is an eminently readable work on the Indian military and India's experiences with wars over a period of roughly twenty-five years after independence. Given the serious neglect of military history in the understanding of India's contemporary history (post-1947)  this is a notable contribution.... Subramaniam has provided us with a useful and thought-provoking book on India's wars until 1971  and one hopes that the next volume on the period after the Bangladesh War will be equally engaging."" --H-Asia ""Retired Indian Air Vice Marshal Subramaniam  who is now an instructor at the Indian National Defence College  has produced a comprehensive history of India's armed forces and their wars  from the First Indo-Pakistan War in 1947  which was sparked by partition and independence through the Third  sometimes known as the Bangladesh War in 1971.... Subramaniam's treatment of policy  strategy  and operations is very good  and his description of tactical encounters are well written  integrating air  ground  and naval operations as appropriate  and are pretty easy to follow.... India's Wars offers an excellent overview of Indian military history since independence for both the professional military historian or the interested layman."" --StrategyPage ""The battle for Goa was an early example of a combined operation for the Indian military  combining land  air  and sea elements. It is one small piece of a growing heritage for that nation  a history that is well told in this book. The work is impressive in its readability and clarity  as the author does not presume any foreknowledge of his subject and strives to make clear a subject relatively unknown in the Western world. The work deftly traces India's military origins in the 20th century."" --Military Heritage ""[Subramaniam] offers a richly detailed history of India's wars with Pakistan  China  and Portugal as well as a balanced appraisal of India's military wartime performance  highlighting successes and failures."" --Military Officer ""Arjun Subramaniam has blazed a trail for other Indian military officers to follow. By carefully analyzing India's early post-independence wars from a joint perspective  he has contributed toward improving not only professional military education in India  but hopefully the conduct of Indian national security policy itself. A magnificent achievement!"" --Ashley J. Tellis  Carnegie Endowment for International Peace ""Deftly telescoping six decades of India's conflicts in a single volume  Arjun Subramaniam presents an objective and compelling tri-service narrative which I found hard to put down. He joins a select band of service officers who have  in the tradition of Thucydides  shown the intellectual acumen as well as courage and perseverance to put pen to paper while still in uniform."" --Admiral Arun Prakash  Indian Navy  (Ret.)  former Chief of Naval Staff and Chairman  Chiefs of Staff Committee ""India's Wars is a very readable and fascinating book that is not simply a recitation of events  but a work punctuated with insights that can be realized only by someone who participated in the events. Providing views of India's military pioneers not previously available  it also addresses the political interactions that are integral to conflict. This is a timely book yielding understanding of India's military history when India's influence on critical geopolitical events is growing."" --Lt. Gen. David A. Deptula  USAF (Ret.)  Dean of the Mitchell Institute of Aerospace Power Studies ""In this turbulent twenty-first century  the rise of India will be critical for understanding global geopolitics. This superb overview of India's military history in the twentieth century is essential to appreciate the role of India in the decades to come."" --Adm. James Stavridis  USN (Ret.)  sixteenth Supreme Allied Commander  NATO  Dean of the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University 				    	 					 About the Author Arjun Subramaniam is a serving Air Vice Marshal in the Indian Air Force.

"Becoming Review An inspirational memoir that also rings true (Gaby Wood Daily Telegraph  Five Stars)Obama's memoir is a genuine page-turner  full of intimacies and reflections. . . Allied to this candour is a steeliness of purpose. It is no exaggeration to say that every page of this book is  explicitly or otherwise  a reproach to Donald Trump  and a call-to-arms to those who would defeat the 45th President and all that he stands for (Matt D'Ancona Evening Standard)This is a rich  entertaining and candid memoir. And overall she's a fun person to sit alongside as she tells you the story of her life  warts and all. . . it is as beautifully written as any piece of fiction  with a similar warm languid tone to Ann Patchett's novel Commonwealth (Viv Groskop i  Five Stars)This revealing memoir offers new insights into her upbringing on the south side of Chicago and the highs and lows of life with Barack Obama. . . Becoming is a 400-page expansion of this essential doctrine ['when they go low  we go high']  without compromising a refreshing level of honesty about what politics really did to her. I have read Barack Obama's two books so far  and this is like inserting a missing piece of reality into the narrative of his dizzying journey (Afua Hirsch Guardian)I found myself lifting my jaw from my chest at the end of every other chapter  not because of any seedy insight into stories I'd always wondered about  but because  armed as I was with knowledge about her career  her mannerisms  and even her elbow-heavy dancing  this was not the Obama I thought I knew. She was more (Kuba Shand-Baptiste Independent)Inspiring. . . After 421 pages of Becoming  I closed the book hoping that one day she would use her formidable intelligence  humanity - and humour - to offer a more tangible vision for how America might fight the rising tides of polarisation and hate (Financial Times)Open and engaging. . . Obama writes with candour about the good times and bad. (Daily Express)Of course  Becoming is Michelle Obama's story  of how she moved from a girl on the South Side of Chicago to becoming one of the most powerful women in the world. But in the final pages of the book  Obama writes  ""It's all a process  steps along a path. Becoming requires equal parts patience and rigor."" Here  Obama is pushing us to reckon with our own becomings - to realise our own story and to have the power to tell it. (The Pool)She's a woman we've all fallen in love with because she radiates joy and wisdom  and Becoming encapsulate this perfectly. It's also deeply honest - reading it makes you feel as though she's your close friend opening up to you (Red Online)Obama writes with a refreshing candor (The Atlantic) 				    	 					 About the Author Michelle Robinson Obama served as First Lady of the United States from 2009 to 2017.

"Centaur: Shortlisted For The William Hill Sports Book of the Year 2017 Review ""Beautifully written and genuinely revealing. It is brilliant. A work of art  Centaur has a rhythm all of its own but more than that  it has an immense depth of soul and spirit. Declan has been brave enough to show himself raw  at his most vulnerable  and Ami has been clever and empathetic in her telling of the story. Together they have made magical music. The rhythm of the prose reads like a Declan Murphy-ridden race: beautiful and steady  balanced and spiritual before unleashing its dangerous sprint to the line."" (Clare Balding)""Emotional and honest  Centaur is an unflinching look at how Murphy 'came back from the dead' and the heavy price extracted for doing so. Centaur is a book haunted by ghosts: lost careers  lost memories  lost friendships and  most devastatingly of all  lost love... Not only a certain candidate for the William Hill sports book of the year but also sure to be on many non-sports fans' end-of-year lists."" (Sarah Hughes Observer)""A magnificent piece of work: never less than enthralling... a thing of dramatic beauty."" (Mail on Sunday)""Deeply powerful  [told with] grace and poetry... an entirely gripping drama."" (Sunday Express)""Brilliant  bold  at times brutal."" (Sunday Telegraph)""Heart-rending... a page-turner."" (The Times)""Riveting... At times  it's an uncomfortable read  but the journey from awakening from a coma and trying to piece together the absent parts of his life is truly heart-rending."" (Robert Cooper  Racing Plus)""Extraordinary... It is a miraculous tale  recounted with searing honesty. Here is a book that goes way beyond the normal ambitions of the sporting autobiography and clears those limits with room to spare.""

"A History of Indian English Literature Review Indian English Literature (IEL) refers to the body of work by writers in India who write in the English language and whose native or co-native language could be one of the numerous languages of India. It is also associated with the works of members of the Indian diaspora  such as V.S. Naipaul and Salman Rushdie  who are of Indian descent. It is frequently referred to as Indo-Anglian literature. (Indo-Anglian is a specific term in the sole context of writing that should not be confused with the term Anglo-Indian). As a category  this production comes under the broader realm of postcolonial literature- the production from previously colonised countries such as India. IEL has a relatively recent history  it is only one and a half centuries old. The first book written by an Indian in English was by Sake Dean Mahomet  titled Travels of Dean Mahomet  Mahomet's travel narrative was published in 1793 in England. In its early stages it was influenced by the Western art form of the novel. Early Indian writers used English unadulterated by Indian words to convey an experience which was essentially Indian. Raja Rao's Kanthapura is Indian in terms of its storytelling qualities. Rabindranath Tagore wrote in Bengali and English and was responsible for the translations of his own work into English. Dhan Gopal Mukerji was the first Indian author to win a literary award in the United States. Nirad C. Chaudhuri  a writer of non-fiction  is best known for his The Autobiography of an Unknown Indian where he relates his life experiences and influences. P.

"Software Testing: Principles and Practices Review I have been working as Software test engineer for more than 4 years and needed a refresher on testing principles. This book should be read by all testers  fresher or professional as it covers a wide array of topics including many methods of testing and even little bit about automation testing. There are very few examples and the topics covered are described in a concise manner. It is useful in covering topics quickly or preparing for an interview and I think this was the intention of the authors. --by Aziz Ansari on May 20  2014I was looking for a book where in I can refresh basics of testing though we do have material available for free on internet but I love reading books gives a feeling of serious studies.

"Change by Design Review “Brown writes with a winning combination of thoughtfulness  pragmatism and enthusiasm... He avoids the trap of presenting design thinking as a panacea. Mr. Brown charts its failures as well as successes…” (New York Times)“It’s like getting golf tips from Tiger Wood’s coach. Tim Brown’s firm IDEO has won more medals for innovative design than anyone in the world. If you want to be more innovative at work or in life  study with the coach of champions.” (Chip Heath  co-author of Made to Stick)“In his new book  the CEO of design shop IDEO shows how even hospitals can transform the way they work by tapping frontline staff to engineer change.” (BusinessWeek)“This should be mandatory reading for marketers and engineers who can’t understand why a product as cool as the Segway wasn’t a breakout hit.” (Inc.)“Tim Brown has written the definitive book on design thinking. Brown’s wit  experience  and compelling stories create a delightful journey. His masterpiece captures the emotions  mindset  and methods required for designing everything from a product  to an experience  to a strategy in entirely different ways.” (Robert I. Sutton  author of The No Asshole Rule)“With people like Brown codifying design thinking  the tools are out there to solve our problems if a few people are willing to attack them with that sort of tenacity.” (Core77)“Tim Brown’s vision  intellect  empathy and humility shine through every page of this book. Change by Design is for dreamers and doers  for corporate executives and NGO leaders  for teachers  students and those interested in the art of innovation.” (Jacqueline Novogratz  founder  Acumen Fund and author  The Blue Sweater)“Design thinking... is a way of seeing the world and approaching constraints that is holistic  interdisciplinary  and inspiring.” (Ivy Ross  executive vice president of marketing  The Gap)“Brown is clear  persuasive  and often funny... Even for those of us without our own sovereign nation or blue-chip corporation  design thinking offers a guide for rethinking and organizing our everyday creative processes.” (SEED)“Brown makes a potent case for employing this creative collaboration in a variety of settings.” (Miami Herald) 				    	 					 From the Back Cover The myth of innovation is that brilliant ideas leap fully formed from the minds of geniuses. The reality is that most innovations come from a process of rigorous examination through which great ideas are identified and developed before being realized as new offerings and capabilities.  This book introduces the idea of design thinking‚ the collaborative process by which the designer′s sensibilities and methods are employed to match people′s needs not only with what is technically feasible and a viable business strategy. In short‚ design thinking converts need into demand. It′s a human−centered approach to problem solving that helps people and organizations become more innovative and more creative.  Design thinking is not just applicable to so−called creative industries or people who work in the design field. It′s a methodology that has been used by organizations such as Kaiser Permanente to icnrease the quality of patient care by re−examining the ways that their nurses manage shift change‚ or Kraft to rethink supply chain management. This is not a book by designers for designers  this is a book for creative leaders seeking to infuse design thinking into every level of an organization‚ product‚ or service to drive new alternatives for business and society.

"We Were Eight Years in Power: An American Tragedy Review “Biting cultural and political analysis from the award-winning journalist . . . [Ta-Nehisi Coates] reflects on race  Barack Obama’s presidency and its jarring aftermath  and his own evolution as a writer in eight stunningly incisive essays. . . . He contextualizes each piece with candid personal revelations  making the volume a melding of memoir and critique. . . . Emotionally charged  deftly crafted  and urgently relevant.”—Kirkus Reviews (starred review) “Ta-Nehisi Coates has published a collection of the major magazine essays he wrote throughout the Obama years. . . . But Coates adds an unexpected element that renders We Were Eight Years in Power both new and revealing. Interspersed among the essays are introductory personal reflections. . . . Together  these introspections are the inside story of a writer at work  with all the fears  insecurities  influences  insights and blind spots that the craft demands. . . . I would have continued reading Coates during a Hillary Clinton administration  hoping in particular that he’d finally write the great Civil War history already scattered throughout his work. Yet reading him now feels more urgent  with the bar set higher.”—Carlos Lozada  The Washington Post“A master class . . . Anyone who wants to know who we are—and where we are now—must sit with [Ta-Nehisi Coates] for a good while. . . . It should inspire us as writers  and as Americans  that he urges us . . . to become better—or at least clearer on why we’re not.”—Kevin Young  The New York Times Book Review“Coates . . . eloquently unfurls blunt truths. . . . Such a voice  in such a moment  is a ray of light.”—USA Today“There is a fresh clarity to [Coates’s] voice—urgent  outraged  electric—that’s never felt more necessary.”—Entertainment Weekly“Indispensable . . . bracing . . . compelling . . . A new book from Coates is not merely a literary event. It’s a launch from Cape Canaveral.”—Jennifer Senior  The New York Times “Essential . . . Coates’s probing essays about race  politics  and history became necessary ballast for this nation’s gravity-defying moment.” —The Boston Globe“Coates’s collection of his essays from the past decade examine the recurrence of certain themes in the black community  the need for uplift and self-reliance  the debate between liberals and conservatives about the right approach to racism  and the virulent reaction in some quarters to any signs of racial progress. . . . Coates’s always sharp commentary is particularly insightful as each day brings a new upset to the cultural and political landscape laid during the term of the nation’s first black president. . . . Coates is a crucial voice in the public discussion of race and equality  and readers will be eager for his take on where we stand now and why.” —Booklist (starred review) “Though the essays are about a particular period  Coates’s themes reflect broader social and political phenomena. It’s this timeless timeliness—reminiscent of the work of George Orwell and James Baldwin—that makes Coates worth reading again and again.”—Publishers Weekly (starred review)  About the Author Ta-Nehisi Coates is a national correspondent for The Atlantic. His book Between the World and Me won the National Book Award in 2015. Coates is the recipient of a MacArthur Fellowship. He lives in New York City with his wife and son.

"Cici A Fairy's Tale 2: Truth in Sight (Graphic Universe) Review ""Cici is adjusting to her parents' divorce and her newly acquired fairy magic. She spends her weekends at her dad's house with her younger sister  Sofia  who cries the entire time  and her days at school lonely after having a falling out with her best friend. Cici gets to know Kendra  the daughter of the man her mother is seeing. Resentful because she believes that Kendra's life is perfect  Cici plays a mean trick on the other girl  distorting the features on Kendra's beloved doll. This alters Kendra's appearance in a way that only Cici and other fairies can see  which leads the protagonist to believe that it isn't causing any lasting harm. When Cici's grandmother discovers the magical misdeeds  she uses the moment to teach the girl an important lesson about her magic. The themes of divorce  friendship  and the implications of magic will resonate with kids. Spanish language is peppered throughout the text  and the vibrant cartoon illustrations give readers insight into the characters' inner lives. VERDICT: Fans of Ashley Spires's 'Binky' books and Victoria Jamieson's new series 'Pets on the Loose!' will be ready to tackle this next. A wonderful addition to a must-have series.""--School Library Journal--Journal""A fledgling Latina fairy learns she must use her magic responsibly. Quintessential preteen Cici is trying to make sense of a turbulent time in her life: her dad has moved out  she's lost her best friend to the popular clique  and she's learning to control her nascent fairy powers. She has the 'fairy sight  ' which means she sees people with a sort of enhanced vision that helps her understand them (for example  she sees her harried mother as a multitasking octopus). One day at school she finds popular white classmate Kendra's beloved princess doll (fairy sight reveals Kendra to be something of a princess as well). Cici  seizing the opportunity to use her powers  chooses to wield them in an unkind way. When Abuela  also a fairy  finds out what she has done  Cici must own up to her wrongdoings. The plot--a friendship-tinged riff on the 'with great power comes great responsibility' theme--is instantly familiar  even with the fantasy elements. Doused liberally with a comely array of warm pinks and purples  the panels have a keen focus on facial elements and hold a high visual appeal. Though this series outing doesn't explore its issues with much real depth  the pleasing style and familiar subject matter helped to compensate  leaving this with a very episodic  sitcom-like feel. A likable protagonist and fantasy elements make this well-trod ground feel fairly fresh.""--Kirkus Reviews--Journal 				    	 					         		         		         	                  	         		About the Author Cori Doerrfeld is a freelance author and illustrator.

"The Museum of Innocence Review “[An] enchanting new novel of first love painfully sustained over a lifetime....The city is on exhibit: the romantic touch of decaying wooden houses  the sturdy apartments of the nouveaux riches  postcard views of the shimmering Golden Horn  Soviet tankers on the Bosporus and a Frenchified restaurant once in favor....Part of the delight in The Museum of Innocence is in scouting out the serious games  yet giving oneself over to the charms of Pamuk’s storytelling….Freely’s translation captures the novelist’s playful performance as well as his serious collusion with Kemal. Her melding of tones follows Pamuk’s agility  to redirect our vision to the gravity of his tale....What’s on show in this museum is the responsibility to write free and modern.”            - Maureen Howard  New York Times Book Review “A Startling original. Every turn in the story seems fresh  disquieting  utterly unexpected...spellbindingly told....The genius of Pamuk’s novel is that although it can be read as a simpel romance  it is a richly complicated work with subtle and intricate layers. Kemal’s descent into love’s hell takes him through every level of the social order  past countless neighborhoods of sprawling Istanbul  in a story that spans 30 years.”            - Marie Arana  The Washington Post “Pamuk...is that rare thing  a creator of sophisticated  intensely literary fiction  who is also his country’s bestselling writer....in part...because of his work’s accessibility and his willingness to adapt conventionally popular genres  like historical and detective stories  into multilayered  character-driven novels....mesmerizing  brilliantly realized...[with] marvelous and transporting evocations of Istanbul…and fascinating insights into a society living very much on the unstable borders of contemporary life between the Islamic and Western worlds....[This] engrossing tale....deeply and compellingly explores the interplay between erotic obsession and sentimentality—and never once slips into the sentimental. There is a master at work in this book.”            - Timothy Rutten  The Los Angeles Times  “Pamuk looks at Europe’s great tradition with a fascination and devotion that few contemporary Europeans would muster…and in doing so  he catches instantly his own—along with his country’s and much of the developing world’s—uneasy position between the indigenous ways they are determined to hold on to and the globalized world they long to belong to. The Museum of Innocence may be Pamuk’s most intimate and nuanced exploration of these stresses yet....Pamuk unfolds a classic  spacious love story a little like a Nabakovian version of Love in the Time of Cholera [and] The Museum of Innocence develops  therefore  into something of a rich and almost-modern Age of Innocence  translated to a confused world that doesn’t know quite how modern it wants to be....[N]o one has given us so unsparing and precise a sense of mock-sophisticated Istanbul society  and no writer has immersed us so passionately in a backward-looking monochrome depiction of Istanbul in its neglected traditional corners....[Pamuk] has given voice to nearly every society in the world torn between the longing to be global and to be itself....[Here he] manages to tell a very straightforward story of a dreamer in love—rendered lucid and fluent and human in Maureen Freely’s translation—that is  beneath its romantic surface  strikingly exact.”            - Pico Iyer  New York Review of Books“While this is a broadly familiar tale  it is also  in so many ways  a stunningly original work…granular and panoramic  satirical and yet grounded in reality. This is a twisted love story  engrossing and sensual in its own right. But Pamuk being Pamuk  it is so much more than that. There is something casually anthropological about Pamuk’s writing. He manages to make a story with stern lessons about class conflicts and…the Eastern versus Western divide  feel both light and weighty. Pamuk is a puckish storyteller…who crafts scenes worthy of the cinema. Vignettes large and small feel vivid….Great writers have made the failed love stories of desperate  self-involved men pulsate. A master  like Pamuk  makes the story feel vital.”            Henry C. Jackson (Associated Press Writer)  San Francisco Chronicle“Pamuk’s sensual  sinister tale is a brilliant panorama of Turkey’s conflicted national identity—and a lacerating critique of a social elite that styles itself after the West but fails to embrace its core freedoms.”            - Vogue “a world-class lesson in heartbreak and happiness....Pamuk’s own presence in this wily narrative is as surreptitious as passion itself.”            - O Magazine“pulses with the hopeful melancholy of an aching heart.”            - Entertainment Weekly “Curious and demanding….The author examines Kemal’s twisted devotion with impressive cunning and inventiveness  inevitably  we think of Nabokov’s Humbert Humbert and his Lolita  but to Pamuk’s credit  the comparison does not diminish this novel’s eloquence or impact. Suggestions of a tradition-bound haute bourgeoisie unable to let go of passing traditions and values feel honestly earned  and the narrative consistently engages and surprises....Another richly women tale suffused with life and color from one of contemporary fiction’s true master craftsmen.”            - Kirkus (starred review) “a soaring  detailed...mausoleum of love....a masterful work.”            - Publisher’s WeeklyFrom the Hardcover edition.  About the Author Orhan Pamuk won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2006. His novel My Name Is Red won the 2003 IMPAC Dublin Literary Award. His work has been translated into more than fifty languages. He lives in Istanbul. 				    	 					              See all Product description"

"The Party: The Secret World of China's Communist Rulers Review Superb in its depiction and demystification of the most important force at work in China today. Essential  riveting guide to how the rising power really works (Jonathan Fenby  author of The Penguin History of Modern China)McGregor is one of the best foreign journalists who have reported from China. The Party draws on two decades of superb reporting ... A fine contribution for those who want to know about the rising power they will face in the decades ahead (Ezra Vogel  Professor Emeritus  Harvard University)This is a marvellous and finely written study of how China is really run  and how its strange but successful system of Leninist capitalism really works. It should be read by anyone doing business with or just trying to understand China (Bill Emmott  former editor of The Economist)Few outsiders have any realistic sense of the innards  motives  rivalries  and fears of the Chinese Communist leadership. But we all know much more than before  thanks to Richard McGregor's illuminating and richly-textured look at the people in charge of China's political machinery ... invaluable for anyone trying to make sense of China's future plans and choices (James Fallows  National Correspondent for The Atlantic)Fascinating and ambitious ... Richard McGregor lays bare the secretive machinery of the party (Gady Epstein Forbes)Indispens­able. If you read only one book about China this year  it should be this one. And if you do not read this book  you probably do not understand China today (Arthur Kroeber China Economic Quarterly)A book that is as informative as it is entertaining  and rich in the sort of anecdotes that put flesh on the bones of his arguments ... China has been transformed. There is no denying it. The system that takes the credit is brilliantly described by McGregor (Chris Patten Financial Times)McGregor has done the world a service with his fascinating new book (Peter Hartcher Sydney Morning Herald)A fascinating read ... in an age when Chinese economic influence is reaching new levels  it is an invaluable exercise in understanding the operation of the most powerful political party in the world (Ian Kehoe Sunday Business Post)A vivid narrative  sprinkled with humour and insightful analysis ... McGregor balances exposition of a heavy and intellectually demanding subject with anecdotes  lively quotes and word portraits of amazing characters  such as maverick ""Mr Idiot Seeds""  Nian Guangjiu  or arrogant  reckless former Shanghai party boss Chen Liangyu ... An engrossing read (South China Morning Post) 				    	 					 From the Inside Flap China's Communist Party is the elephant in the room. The Party is a revelatory investigation into its integral role in the country's rise as a global superpower.The political and economic growth of China in the past three decades is one of astonishing  epochal dimensions. The country has undergone a remarkable transformation on a scale similar to the industrial revolution in the West. The most remarkable part of this transformation  however  has been largely left untold-the central role of the Chinese Communist Party.As an organization alone  the Party is a phenomenon of unique scale and power. With more than seventy-three million members  it does more than just rule a country. The Party not only has a grip on every aspect of government  from the largest  richest cities to the smallest far-flung villages in Tibet and Xinjiang  it also has a hold on all official religions  the media  and the military. The Party presides over large  wealthy state-owned businesses  and it exercises control over the selection of senior executives of all government companies  many of which are in the top tier of the Fortune 500 list. In The Party  Richard McGregor delves deeply into China's inner sanctum for the first time  showing how the Communist Party controls the country  and how it keeps all corruption accusations against its members in-house. As the world's new geo-political force  the Party's decisions have a global impact  yet it remains a deeply secretive body  hostile to the law  unaccountable to anybody or anything other than its own internal tribunals  and primed to think the worst of the West. How did China's Communists merge Marx  Mao and the market to create a new superpower? How have they managed to maintain power in the face of a rapidly changing world. In this provocative and illuminating account  Richard McGregor offers a captivating portrait of China's Communist Party  its grip on power and control over China  and its future.

"God  Sex  and Gender: An Introduction Review Many of the critiques of God  Sex  and Genderoffered in this review emerge from Thatcher s own lines of interrogation. In this and other ways  the book succeeds in drawing readers into what is truly an exhilarating mode of reflection. As such  it offers a major contribution towards theological depth and creativity in this important set of discourses  renewing the often reflexive ethics of sex and gender through witness to the Word become flesh. (Studies in Christian Ethics  16 April 2014) Written as a text for post-secondary courses  this book aims to provide a comprehensive and consistent theological understanding of sexuality and gender  which is broad  contemporary  undogmatic  questioning  inclusive  and relevant to readers interests  needs  and experience (xi). (Studies in Religion  1 September 2013) ""Adrian Thatcher's new book will be a rich resource for those studying and teaching sex  gender and sexuality in theological perspective ... The volume is a valuable one  which I hope will prompt readers to go and explore Thatcher's own extensive work form the past  as well as the broader context of theological scholarship on sexuality  gender and marriage within which it sits."" (Theology  1 January 2012) ""Here is a clear and coherent account of where we are in terms of Christian teaching and practice about sex and gender  and it should appeal to students and general readers alike."" (Church Times  26 August 2011) ""A theologian offers a theology of both sexuality and gender  discussing such topics as homosexuality and same-sex unions."" (Publishers Weekly  8 March 2011) 				    	 					 From the Back Cover The last 50 years have seen unprecedented changes in sexual and gender relationships. These include the easy availability of contraception  the separation of sexual experience from marriage and marriage from parenthood  more broken marriages  and legal provision for same-sex unions. Relationships between men and women have changed from a model of male dominance  towards a new model of male/female equality  and on to a new recognition of sexual and gender difference. These transformations have resulted in great benefits but they have also generated great uncertainties and unfulfilled expectations. They have sparked painful and on-going controversies in all the churches. God  Sex  and Gender is a clear and engaging introduction to these issues. It offers a consistent theological understanding which is contemporary  undogmatic  questioning  and relevant to readers' experience  interests and needs.Throughout the book  Thatcher connects theological ideas  with broader  secular thought. It fills a gap in the literature by linking together the diverse themes of sexuality  gender and Christian thought in one coherent volume. Its comprehensive and even-handed discussion of these issues will ensure it becomes a vital text in the field. 				    	 					              See all Product description"

An Astronaut's Guide to Life on Earth Review WINNER 2013 – CBA Libris Non-Fiction Book of the Year Award #1 NATIONAL BESTSELLERNEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER A Globe and Mail Best BookA Book Riot Best BookA Slate Best Book“Chris Hadfield is easily the world’s most famous living moustache-tronaut  having done more to promote the concept of off-Earth travel and exploration than anyone since William Shatner first stepped onto the bridge of the Enterprise…. The accounts of Hadfield’s three missions are riveting and fun  and easily communicate the shock and awe that comes with seeing the planet from above.” —Toronto Star “Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield presents an inspiring tale of his own perseverance in pursuing his dream. There are many interesting tidbits about space included here that can only be related by someone who has been there.” —The Vancouver Sun “Canadians young to old will be awed and inspired by Chris Hadfield’s story. His passion  commitment and extraordinary achievements make him a larger-than-life hero.” —Heather Reisman  Indigo’s Chief Booklover and CEO“Remember that Canadian dude with the moustache who sang an amazing accomplished zerogravity version of Space Oddity on the International Space Station this year? It turns out he can write  too. An Astronaut’s Guide to Life on Earth is the book Chris Hadfield was destined to produce from the moment they pulled him out of his Soyuz space capsule on the Kazakh steppe and told him he had seven million YouTube hits. It is unapologetically gung-ho  and it instantly takes its place on the admittedly lonely shelf of books that make the case for human space exploration in the post-Apollo  post-Shuttle age. . . . The book was written at speed but feels thoughtful rather than hasty. . . . It’s a fine line . . . between the small stuff and the life and death stuff that gives Hadfield’s tale its juice. Not many people can describe from experience the difference between a Shuttle launch . . . and a launch in a Russian Proton rocket. . . .  Not many people know what it is to glance behind you on a spacewalk and almost accidentally ‘notice the Universe.’” —Giles Whittell  The Sunday Times  “I found his fascinating An Astronaut’s Guide to Life on Earth even more enjoyable than I expected. Mr. Hadfield teaches us not only about space but about people  too. Equally autobiographical and instructional  the book goes gleefully against the grain of most ‘success’ books…. An Astronaut’s Guide to Life on Earth isn’t a compendium of hagiographic profiles  it’s a very human glimpse into a rarefied world. Bound together by a love of exploration and discovery  tested by tragic catastrophes and everyday hardship  the men and women Mr. Hadfield introduces us to are real people: They fail  they succeed  they worry  they miss their families  they go to space and do things never done before. The vacuum of space is unforgiving and brutal. Life on earth isn’t easy  either. Mr. Hadfield has genuinely and refreshingly increased our understanding of how to thrive in both places.” —Adam Savage  The Wall Street Journal  “Hadfield is a good writer with an engaging style  I was always eager to get to the next chapter  and frequently found myself smiling at the stories he was spinning…. You might not think that someone who became an astronaut might have stories that will relate to your own Earthbound life  but in fact Hadfield has shown over and again that he’s a master at making it all relatable. From his photos of Earth from space to his videos showing the daily grind of life on a 100-meter wide orbiting tin can  he is all about real life.” —Phil Plait  Slate (Best Book) “A page-turning memoir of life as a decorated astronaut.” —Kirkus Reviews“The book is a trove of good advice on everything from personal development to survival  but he also knows a hell of a lot about getting the job—any job—done.” —AskMen“Not a business book per se  Colonel Hadfield’s memoir recounts how insatiable curiosity  single-minded dedication and a healthy competitive streak propelled him to  quite literally  out-of-this world accomplishments. His humility and charm throughout his ascent to notoriety are further evidence that a winning formula includes staying true to yourself.” —Simon Kennedy  The Washington Post “The world has been given the gift of the first book from Col. Chris Hadfield  Commander of the International Space Station. Who wouldn’t want to read about the man who broke into the Space Station with a Swiss army knife  performed basic surgery in zero gravity  and was temporarily blinded while clutching the exterior of an orbiting spacecraft? . . . Now in Hadfield’s book readers come even closer to the man whose life and career have been seemingly other-worldly. An Astronaut’s Guide includes eye-opening  adrenaline-filled stories of shuttle launches and space walks but it is also filled with Hadfield’s counterintuitive life lessons.” —Euro Weekly News  About the Author Chris Hadfield is one of the most seasoned and accomplished astronauts in the world. The top graduate of the U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School in 1988 and U.S. Navy test pilot of the year in 1991  Hadfield was selected by the Canadian Space Agency to be an astronaut in 1992. He was CAPCOM for 25 Shuttle launches and served as Director of NASA Operations in Star City  Russia  from 2001–2003  Chief of Robotics at the Johnson Space Center in Houston from 2003–2006  and Chief of International Space Station Operations from 2006–2008. Hadfield most recently served as Commander of the International Space Station where  while conducting a record-setting number of scientific experiments and overseeing an emergency spacewalk  he gained worldwide acclaim for his breathtaking photographs and educational videos about life in space. His music video  a zero-gravity version of David Bowie’s “Space Oddity ” received over 10 million views in its first three days online.

Ami Enterprises Tickles White Sequence Card Game Toy  White (25 cm) With touches of canasta  rummy  and poker  this game could easily become a Friday night favorite. The object is to get a sequence  meaning a row of five poker like chips on the game board. The board itself depicts lines of face up playing cards. Players place their crowning chips on top of the card pictures  and can form sequences by using strategy and knowing which sequence cards to keep or discard. Since forethought  luck  and backup plans are the keys to winning  this game is probably too sophisticated for children under 7 years old. (But young ones can team up with adults.) Included are 104 playing cards and 50 crowning chips in each colour: red  blue  and green.

"The Unwomanly Face of War: An Oral History of Women in World War II Review “A monument to courage . . . It would be hard to find a book that feels more important or original. . . . [Svetlana] Alexievich’s account of the second world war as seen through the eyes of hundreds of women is an extraordinary thing. . . . Her achievement is as breathtaking as the experiences of these women are awe-inspiring.”—The Guardian   “Magnificent . . . After decades of the war being remembered by ‘men writing about men ’ she aims to give voice to an aging generation of women who found themselves dismissed not just as storytellers but also as veterans  mothers and even potential wives. . . . Alexievich presents less a straightforward oral history of World War II than a literary excavation of memory itself.”—The New York Times Book Review   “Could not have appeared at a more opportune time . . . Women did everything—this book reminds and reveals. They learned to pilot planes and drop bombs  to shoot targets from great distances. . . . Alexievich has turned their voices into history’s psalm.”—The Boston Globe   “Harrowing and moving . . . Alexievich did an enormous service  recovering these stories. . . .The Unwomanly Face of War tells the story of these forgotten women  and its great achievement is that it gives credit to their contribution but also to the hell they endured.”—The Washington Post   “We should resolve to read this book alongside the world news report. . . .  Ms. Alexievich never tries to simplify. . . . Refusing to pass judgment  crediting all  she listens  suffers and brings to life. . . . It took years and many miles of traveling to find and capture all the testimonies here. . . . We still end up feeling that we have been sitting at her side. With her  we hear the memories of partisans  guerrilla fighters trapped behind the lines.”—The Wall Street Journal   “Alexievich has forged her own distinctive identity: as a witness to witnesses who usually go unheard. . . . In a ‘post-truth’ era when journalism is under pressure—susceptible to propaganda  sensationalism  and ‘alternative facts’—the power of documentary literature stands out more clearly than ever. . . . Listen to Alexievich.”—The Atlantic   “[A] remarkable collection of testimonies . . . Sitting at kitchen tables  Alexievich coaxes out of the women stories that describe a reality vastly different from the officially sanctioned version. . . . They speak guardedly but vividly of fleeting encounters  deep relationships  unexpressed feelings.”—The New Yorker   “Continually shocking and tearjerking . . . The introductory materials here  in which Alexievich quotes from the journals she kept while working on the project and from her later reflections and dealings with censors  are as compelling as the primary text.”—The Christian Science Monitor“Alexievich gives us an idea of how the army women were perceived by society  during the war and afterwards. . . . These voices  thanks to Alexievich  have themselves become part of history.”—Financial Times  About the Author Svetlana Alexievich was born in Ivano-Frankivsk  Ukraine  in 1948 and has spent most of her life in the Soviet Union and present-day Belarus  with prolonged periods of exile in Western Europe. Starting out as a journalist  she developed her own nonfiction genre  which gathers a chorus of voices to describe a specific historical moment. Her works include The Unwomanly Face of War (1985)  Last Witnesses (1985)  Zinky Boys (1990)  Voices from Chernobyl (1997)  and Secondhand Time (2013).

"Ancient India Review ''Though  now there are many important studies available on the subject  the book remains one of the pioneering works in the field.'' - --NBT News LetterThe author had discovered 'important fragments of the dramas of the great Buddhist poet Avaghosa  and of the plays of the famous Bhasa'  which had thrown unexpected light on the early history of the drama in India  which students of theatre must know. The value and significance of Indian dramatic theory had retained its relevance so long that even today they continue to receive recognition universally. Hence this reprint. .....An excellent treatise to equip one with the authentic knowledge of ancient Indian theatre traditions. --Indian and World Arts and Crafts  Vol. XIV  November 1995The book published nearly seventy years ago  is still relevant and makes interesting reading. Though its coverage encompasses only a segment of Sanskrit drama  after having read the very informative book  one cannot but agree with Prof. Keith that ""the Sanskrit drama can be legitimately regarded as the highest product of Indian poetry and as summing up in itself the first conception of literary art achieved by the very self conception of literary art achieved by the very self conscious creation of Indian literature. --J.

"Nuel Belnap on Indeterminism and Free Action (Outstanding Contributions to Logic) From the Back Cover This volume seeks to further the use of formal methods in clarifying one of the central problems of philosophy: that of our free human agency and its place in our indeterministic world. It celebrates the important contributions made in this area by Nuel Belnap  American logician and philosopher.Philosophically  indeterminism and free action can seem far apart  but in Belnap’s work  they are intimately linked. This book explores their philosophical interconnectedness through a selection of original research papers that build forth on Belnap’s logical and philosophical work. Some contributions take the form of critical discussions of Belnap's published work  some develop points made in his publications in new directions  and others provide additional insights on the topics of indeterminism and free action.In Nuel Belnap’s work on indeterminism and free action  three formal frameworks figure prominently: the simple branching histories framework known as ""branching time "" its relativistic spatio-temporal extension  branching space-times  and the “seeing to it that” (stit) logic of agency. As those frameworks provide the formal background for the contributed papers  the volume introduction gives an overview of the current state of their development. It also introduces case-intensional first order logic (CIFOL)  a general intensional logic offering resources for a first-order extension of the mentioned frameworks and a recent research focus of Belnap’s. The volume also contains an extended biographical interview with Nuel Belnap."

Pinker convincingly demonstrates that there has been a dramatic decline in violence  and he is persuasive about the causes of that decline (Peter Singer New York Times)[A] sweeping new review of the history of human violence...[Pinker has] the kind of academic superbrain that can translate otherwise impenetrable statistics into a meaningful narrative of human behaviour...impeccable scholarship (Tony Allen-Mills Sunday Times)Written in Pinker's distinctively entertaining and clear personal style...a marvellous synthesis of science  history and storytelling (Clive Cookson Financial Times)A salutary reality-check...Better Angels is itself a great liberal landmark (Marek Kohn Independent)Pinker's scholarhsip is astounding...flawless...masterful (Joanna Bourke The Times)Selected by the New York Times as one of the 100 Notable Books of 2011 (New York Times) 				    	 					 About the Author Steven Pinker is one of the world's most influential thinkers and writers on the human condition.

Leahy  Ph.D.  Director  American Institute for Cognitive Therapy “In this innovative handbook  Dr. Boyes identifies common habits that underlie different types of anxiety.  She then offers clear strategies to drop the fight and become more gentle with ourselves. If anxiety has limited your life in any way  this book is an excellent place to start the healing process.” —Christopher Germer  PhD  Clinical Instructor  Harvard Medical School  Co-editor  Mindfulness and Psychotherapy  author  The Mindful Path to Self-Compassion   “The Anxiety Toolkit is an investment in wellness. Based on years of clinical practice and research  Dr. Alice Boyes has written a real-world roadmap for all of us who struggle with making decisions and feeling stuck.” —Chris Guillebeau  New York Times bestselling author of The Happiness of Pursuit and The $100 Startup “Buying self-help books is much like buying furniture that requires assembly---the picture on the cover always looks great but what really matters is the clarity and usability of the instructions inside. Alice Boyes' mastery at breaking down psychological concepts and strategies into easy-to-understand clear steps anyone can apply  the many self-assessment quizzes she provides  and the overall thoroughness of her approach makes The Anxiety Toolkit an incredibly useful and practical book. If you suffer from anxiety or think you might and are serious about changing how it impacts your life  this is the book for you!” ---Guy Winch  Ph.D.  author of Emotional First Aid and The Squeaky Wheel “I have read many books on how to manage and work with anxiety.

Boyes  who claims that she  too  has been ""anxiety-prone "" begins by explaining that anxiety itself isn't the problem. It can actually be beneficial by making us more cautious and methodical in our tasks. The problem lies in how we become trapped by our real or perceived fears and are unable to act. Boyes concentrates on five areas—hesitancy  rumination and worry  perfectionism  fear of feedback  and avoidance—where anxiety can lead to bottlenecks. She begins each chapter with a quiz  allowing readers to gauge their needs  and then offers ""experiments"" suggesting specific  safe breakthrough techniques such as visualizing positive alternative outcomes or remembering successes. The therapist takes care to suggest nonthreatening options and to remind readers that working with their tendencies  not against them  delivers greater results. Far from the pat ""don't worry  be happy"" approach  Boyes' practical  easy-to-follow methods will be reassuring and useful to a wide range of readers.""---Booklist   About the Author Dr. Alice Boyes is an emotions expert and a popular blogger for Psychology Today.

"Get Out Of Your Mind And Into Your Life: The New Acceptance and Commitment Therapy Amazon.com Review Trying to ""change"" negative thoughts through cognitive gymnastics is like trying to win a war single-handedly. Why waste a life trying the impossible? In Get Out of Your Mind and Into Your Life: The New Acceptance and Commitment Therapy  advocate Dr. Steven Hayes escorts the mildly depressed  angry  and anxiety prone through a new approach to handling suffering--universal human suffering caused by language's illusions. Rather than fighting off bad thoughts and feelings with internal pep talks  Hayes beautifully explains how to embrace those pessimistic and foreboding mental voices (much like welcoming home one's cranky  play-worn children)  ""defuse"" them with respectful attention  and commit to leading a purposeful life that includes their occasional ranting. Intriguing exercises help readers identify their core struggles  parse these into manageable pieces  and develop effective ways to move beyond rumination. The work progresses easily  thanks to Hayes' engaging style and his grace in coaching readers. Critics of cognitive and behavioral therapies will warm to Hayes' logical explanations of language's pitfalls (even language used by other therapeutic approaches)  his sometimes goofy--but surprisingly effective--exercises  well-timed etymology lessons  and his uncanny ability to predict and skillfully address reader reactions throughout the workbook. Ironically  the path to life clocks many hours in the mind  plan to dedicate an intensive month of introspection to this program. Anyone who has been accused of thinking too much  who begrudges compliments  pines for a different life  or feels trapped at a mental dead end can benefit from Hayes' superior guidance.--Liane Thomas Dr. Steven Hayes answers a few questions about his book  and describes how his research was inspired by his own struggles with panic and anxiety.  Questions for Steven Hayes  Amazon.com: Can you give us a lay person's primer on acceptance and commitment therapy? Steven Hayes: Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is based on a rather remarkable fact: when normal problem solving skills are applied to psychologically painful thoughts or feelings  suffering often increases. Our research program has shown this in thousands of patients  in almost every area of human suffering. Fortunately  we have discovered why this is and we have developed some ways of correcting it.  The basic research underlying ACT shows that entanglement with your own mind leads automatically to experiential avoidance: the tendency to try first to remove or change negative thoughts and feelings as a method of life enhancement. This attempted sequence makes negative thoughts and feelings more central  important  and fearsome--and often decreasing the ability to be flexible  effective  and happy.   The trick that traps us is that these unhelpful mental processes are fed by agreement OR disagreement. Your mind is like a person who has to be right about everything. If you know any people like that you know that they are excited when you agree with them but they can be even more excited and energized when you argue with them! Minds are like that. So what do you do?   ACT teaches you what to do. I will say what that is  but readers need to understand that these mere words will not be useful in and of themselves. Minds are too clever for that! That is why the book has so many exercises and why we have a free discussion group on line for people working through the book (http://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/ACT_for_the_Public/). What ACT teaches is acceptance of emotions  mindful awareness of thoughts  contact with a transcendent sense of self  and action based on chosen values. This constellation of skills has shown itself in controlled research to help with an amazingly large range of problems  from anxiety to managing the challenges of physical disease  from depression  to stopping smoking. Amazon.com: Some of this work is said to have come from your own battles with anxiety and panic. How did these ideas apply to your own struggles?  Steven Hayes: It was my own panic disorder that first put me on to the problem we have now confirmed in our research. My panic disorder began a little over 25 years ago. I watched in horror as it grew rapidly  simply by applying my normal problem solving skills to it. Anxiety felt awful and seemingly made it impossible to function  so it was obvious to me that I first needed to get rid of it before my life would improve. I tried lots of things to do that. But this very effort meant I had to constantly evaluate my level of anxiety  and fearfully check to see if it was going up or down as a result of my efforts. As a result  anxiety quickly became the central focus of my life. Anxiety itself became something to be anxious about  and meanwhile life was put on hold.  After two or three years of this I'd had enough. I began to experiment with acceptance  mindfulness  and valued action instead of detecting  disputing  and changing my insides.  I remember a moment that symbolizes the change in direction. In the middle of a panic attack  with a guttural scream like you hear in the movies  I literally shouted out loud to my own mind. ""You can make me feel pain  you can make me feel anxiety "" I yelled. ""But you cannot make me turn away from my own experience.""  It has not been a smooth path and it was several years before anxiety itself was obviously way down (getting it to go down was no longer my purpose  remember  but ironically when you stop trying to make it happen  often it does)  but almost immediately life opened up again. ACT is the result of over 20 years of research  following the lead this provided. Amazon.com: You are a language researcher and chapter two of Get Out of Your Mind and Into Your Life is called ""Why Language Leads to Suffering."" Can you tell us why you suggest that language is a source of human suffering?  Steven Hayes: Human language (by that I mean our symbolic abilities generally) is central to effective human cognition. It evolved to keep us from starving or being eaten--and it has done a pretty good job of that.   The key to symbolic processes is the ability to relate events in new and arbitrary ways. Our research program has shown this ability even in 14 month old babies  and we now know it comes from direct training from parents and others as part of normal language development. It is a wonderful skill. It allows us to imagine futures that have never been  and to compare situations that have never actually been experienced. That is the every essence of human verbal problem solving.  But that same process has a downside for human beings. For example  it allows us to fear things we have never experienced (e.g.  death). It allows us to run from the past or compare the dull present to a fantasized future and to be unhappy as a result. And in my case it lead to the common sense but ultimately unhelpful idea that I needed to get rid of anxiety before I could live well.  We get a lot of training in how to develop and use our minds  but we get very little training in how to step out of the mental chatter when that is needed. As a result  this mental tool begins to use us. It will even claim to BE us. The overextension of human language and cognition  I believe  is at the core of the vast majority of human suffering in the developed world and human technology (the media) is only amplifying the problem by exposing us to an ever increasing stream of symbols and images. Learning how to get out of your mind and into your life when you need to do that is an essential skill in the modern world. Review ""With kindness  erudition  and humor  the authors of Get Out of Your Mind and Into Your Life educate readers into a new way of thinking about psychological issues in general and life satisfaction in particular. Their combination of cutting-edge research and resonance with ancient  tried-and-true practices makes this one of the most fascinating and illuminating self-help books available. If you're tired of standard psychological parlance and still frustrated with your quality of life  this book can be a godsend."" --Martha Beck  columnist for O Magazine and author of Finding Your Own North Star and Expecting Adam. ""This manual  firmly based on cutting-edge psychological science and theory  details an innovative and rapidly growing approach that can provide you with the power to transform your very experience of life. Highly recommended for all of us."" --David H. Barlow  professor of psychology  research professor of psychiatry  and director of the Center for Anxiety and Related Disorders at Boston University. ""This is the quintessential workbook on acceptance and commitment therapy. Written with wit  clinical wisdom  and compassionate skepticism  it succeeds in showing us that  paradoxically  there is great therapeutic value in going out of our minds. Once released from the struggle with thought  we are free to discover that a life of meaning and value is closer at hand than thought allowed. This book will serve patients  therapists  researchers  and educators looking for an elegant exposition of the nuts and bolts of this exciting approach."" --Zindel V. Segal  Ph.D.  the Morgan Firestone Chair in Psychotherapy and professor of psychiatry and psychology at the University of Toronto and author of Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy for Depression. ""This book is a user-friendly tool for clinicians who may be looking for adjunct handouts for clients with a wide variety of issues. Exercises found within can help deepen  structure  or guide experiences contacted in session. As a stand-alone self-help book  it brings to light the guiding principles that make ACT such an empowering approach. I highly recommend this book to clinicians and laypeople alike."" --Sandra Georgescu  Psy.D.  assistant professor at the Chicago School of Professional Psychology.

100 World’s Greatest Love Poems 
"Men are from Mars  Women are from Venus Review Relationship counselor John Gray focuses on the differences between men and women--men are from Mars  and women are from Venus  after all--and offers a simple solution: couples must acknowledge and accept these differences before they can develop happier relationships. In this unabridged version  Gray gives a spirited delivery of his message  especially when role-playing typical male/female interactions. Although it takes some time to adjust to his slightly nasal tone  the information is sound and gives both men and women helpful hints on improving themselves and their union. (Running time: 9.5 hours  6 cassettes)""Devoted readers praise Mr. Gray as the saviour of their marriages and his book as the brick that finally knocks some sense into their mates"" Washington Times ""When I was 21 and freshly dumped by Harry  my first really grown-up boyfriend  where did I turn but John Gray's Men Are From Mars  Women Are From Venus? It was reassuring to know the reason I'd been dumped wasn't because I was rubbish in bed"" New Woman ""Men Are From Mars and Women Are From Venus has shed light on countless relationship problems  offering an explanation for many social inequalities!a hot topic of debate in households and offices throughout the world""Popular marriage counselor and seminar leader John Gray provides a unique  practical and proven way for men and women to communicate and relate better by acknowledging the differences between them.Once upon a time Martians and Venusians met  fell in love  and had happy relationships together because they respected and accepted their differences. Then they came to earth and amnesia set in: they forgot they were from different planets.Using this metaphor to illustrate the commonly occurring conflicts between men and women  Gray explains how these differences can come between the sexes and prohibit mutually fulfilling loving relationships. Based on years of successful counseling of couples  he gives advice on how to counteract these differences in communication styles  emotional needs and modes of behavior to promote a greater understanding between individual partners. Gray shows how men and women react differently in conversation and how their relationships are affected by male intimacy cycles (""get close""  ""back off"")  and female self-esteem fluctuations (""I'm okay""  ""I'm not okay""). He encourages readers to accept the other gender's particular way of expressing love  and helps men and women learn how to fulfill each other's emotional needs.With practical suggestions on how to reduce conflict  crucial information on how to interpret a partner's behavior and methods for preventing emotional ""trash from the past"" from invading new relationships  Men Are from Mars  Women Are from Venus is a valuable tool for couples who want to develop deeper and more satisfying relationships with their partners. Book Description First published in 1993  this book has become an international publishing phenomenon and is one of the most famous non-fiction publications of all time.

"The New Middle East: The World After the Arab Spring Review “Danahar weaves a complex narrative into a lively  accessible read  much of which should withstand the passage of time . . . A solid but easygoing compendium for anyone who wants a read beyond the headlines  done with a journalistic lightness of touch.” ―Daily Telegraph“The optimistic take on the Arab revolution  though  is that the coups and massacres are part of a messy process that will eventually lead to more democratically responsive societies. This argument threads its way through Danahar's remarkable analysis of the Arab Spring . . . This is a book that tries to engage with people who can speak for everyone in the Spring  from Brotherhood activists . . . to Israeli and Egyptian generals. It is written in a spirit of adventure . . . And is all the better for it.” ―The Times“A timely exploration of an unstable region still on the brink of change and revolution.” ―Traveller“Are you confused by the welter in the Middle East  headlines crowded with revolution and coup  Islamism  civil war and resurgent jihad? May I recommend Paul Danahar's excellent regional survey  The New Middle East: The World After the Arab Spring? Danahar is the BBC's Middle East bureau chief  experienced and clear eyed. His style is crisp and elegant  equally adept at telling human portraits as interviewing generals and presidents and sketching historical context . . . The events of the Arab Spring and its aftermath will continue to defy prediction  but in the meantime  it's worth reading Danahar to take stock of some of the geopolitical tectonic shifts and the forces that are remaking our old assumptions.” ―Prospect“He reports perceptively on the internal contradictions of the Jewish state  from militant settlers to the ultraorthodox Haredim.” ―Guardian About the Author Paul Danahar is the BBC's Middle East Bureau Chief and ran the organization's news coverage of the Arab Spring. He has reported from Iraq  Iran and North Korea--every nation in the ""Axis of Evil."" In 2013 he was appointed the BBC's North America Bureau Chief  based in Washington  DC.

"The Dental Diet: The Surprising Link between Your Teeth  Real Food  and Life-Changing Natural Health Review Dental health is almost a forgotten topic when we think about our overall health  but what if the health of our teeth and gums could alert us to problems like diabetes and Alzheimer's? Dr. Lin makes a powerful case for not only paying more attention to our dental health  but he makes the case that what is healthy for the mouth  is healthy for our whole being. (Robb Wolf  New York Times and Wall Street Journal best-selling author of 'The Paleo Solution' and 'Wired to Eat')The future of medicine is interconnected in every way. The oral-systemic link is an obvious example of this greatertrend  and I am thrilled to see dentists like Dr. Steven Lin leading the way in showing why we must work togetherto change the trajectory of healthcare worldwide. (James Maskell  founder of Evolution of Medicine and author of 'The Evolution of Medicine')The Dental Diet is an incredible resource. Grounded in new understandings of the critical importance of the oral microbiome to overall health  Dr. Lin leads the way with a unique action-based food plan that is a must-read foranyone wanting to enhance oral health and well-being. (Mark Burhenne  DDS  author of 'The 8-Hour Sleep Paradox')Dr. Lin is a complete breath of fresh air in the Lifestyle Medicine community. I've personally learned an enormous amount from his work  and I'm thrilled to see that he is creating a book to make this more available to the public. The dental-body connection is fascinating and completes a missing link for many people worldwide. The Dental Diet is a must for every patient and medical practitioner to read and understand for better overall health. (Rupy Aujla  M.D.  author of 'The Doctor’s Kitchen')As an orthodontist that tries to help kids grow up with straight teeth  I know we have to go back to the basics: breathing  posture  sleep  and nutrition. From the moment of the first suckle  what we eat and how we eat it is critical to the final outcome of the face  airway  jaws  and teeth. Dr. Lin's prescription is just what the doctor should be ordering. (Barry Raphael  DMD  founder of The Raphael Center for Integrative Orthodontics)Crooked teeth are a sign of a deeper underlying problem. Dr. Lin's book provides a much needed look into the profound impact diet has on dental health. It also provides key strategies for parents to ensure their children have a diet that will support optimal dental and whole body health. (Dr. Michael Ruscio  researcher  health enthusiast  and host of Dr. Ruscio Radio)Dr. Lin's revolutionary leadership in nutrition and dentistry connected so many dots during our interview we are thrilled his important better health recommendations are now widely accessible in The Dental Diet! (Ashley Koff  R.D.  and Robyn O’Brien  co-hosts of 'Take Out with Ashley & Robyn')Dr. Lin's work is timely and addresses an important  upcoming field which few have ventured into thus far.

I strongly recommend this book to students  doctors  dentists  and researchers in nutrition  dietetics  and obesity  as well as other healthcare professionals. (Professor Dave Singh  DDSC  Ph.D.  DMD  president of Vivos BioTechnologies  Inc.)As an orthodontist  long ago  I saw the limitations of simply straightening teeth to improve a patient's smile. Over the last few decades  I have witnessed a paradigm shift in the focus of the dental industry through both speaking internationally and training thousands of dentists in the importance of functional airway dentistry. I believe the next step is for the profession to further integrate preventative steps  which is being led by Dr. Lin's nutrition program to address the malocclusion epidemic. (Dr. Derek Mahony  specialist orthodontist at Full Face Orthodontics)This book takes a preventative stance towards dentistry  and investigates everything from breastfeeding to gut bacteria  to uncover how to support a truly healthy mouth. (Psychologies magazine) 				    	 					         		         		         	                  	         		About the Author Dr Steven Lin is a board-accredited dentist  speaker and author. Frustrated by the dental profession's limited approach to applying treatments without addressing the cause of disease  Dr Lin merged anthropological  physiological  and nutritional science with oral health to integrate effective prevention strategies into his dental practice.

He is the dental expert for I Quit Sugar  the online platform of bestselling author Sarah Wilson.

"The Five Love Languages of Children Review This outstanding book addresses how each child (adults as well) expresses and receives love best through one of five primary ""languages"" - quality time  words of affirmation  gifts  acts of service  or physical touch. Although children need to be spoken to in each of these love languages  there's one love language that meets their deepest emotional needs and should be used often with them (and authors caution how you use that language for discipline). The information in this book complements books that address communicating with children based on their temperament (such as ""Raising your Spirited Child"" and ""Kids  Parents  and Power Struggles"" by Mary Sheedy Kurcinka). I also appreciate that the author included an informative chapter on ""love languages in marriage""  instead of just a one-liner encouraging readers to buy his book dedicated to that subject. Bottom line - Even if you've read tons of parenting books  you will truly learn something new from this one - something to enhance your relationship with your child and adults in your life. You'll probably even learn something about yourself. --By Nature Mom w/ 2 children 25 July 2001This book has revolutionised the way I communicate with  and discipline my children. Within the space of three days my three year old has gone from being difficult for me to deal with to being a pleasant child who responds to discipline in a positive manner. Our home has become more of a haven than a battlefield! Learning to communicate with my children in their primary love language has been the BEST thing that has happened to my parenting  and to their self esteem. I would highly recommend this book to any parent of young children. I will certainly be re-reading it through the years of their lives. --By A Customer 15 March 2000Listening to the audio version of this excellent book is a great use of your time while driving to work. The five love languages concepts and how to apply them in raising and loving your children and even improving your marriage are eye-opening and thought-provoking. I believe I will listen to this tape again and again over the years as I raise my young daughter. I highly recommend the audio version for all young  busy families! --By A Customer 5 August 1999 				    	 					 About the Author Gary Chapman is a relationship counselor and author of the The 5 Love Languages series. He is the director of Marriage and Family Life Consultants  Inc. He also has a radio program on marriage and relationships that airs on over 100 stations and can be heard via the internet.He is a graduate of the Moody Bible Institute and holds a Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) and Master of Arts (M.A.) degree in anthropology from Wheaton College and from Wake Forest University.

"A Rage for Order: The Middle East in Turmoil  from Tahrir Square to ISIS Review This is the book on the Middle East you have been waiting to read. [It] tells the story of the 2011 Arab Spring and its slide into autocracy and civil war better than I could ever imagine its being told. The volume is remarkably slender for one of such drama and scope - beautifully written ... All great works of fiction are works of great philosophy  pondering the fundamentals of humanity. Few volumes of non-fiction ever achieve this  but Worth's does  touching essential human truths about the human condition ... The writing is so beautiful and the storytelling so easy that you won't realize how much you are learning as you read. But there is no escaping the import of the stories. No way to read this marvellous book and not understand far more than you did before about this troubled region and the people struggling to find their way back to quiet lives New York Times Review of Books Riveting  vivid  lucid  and wise  Robert F. Worth's A Rage for Order is reportage of the highest order: it illuminates current Middle Eastern crises through the daily experiences of ordinary  and extraordinary  men and women. I've read no finer or more nuanced account. -- Claire Messud The best way to make sense of the past six years is to ask the Arab people what happened ... Robert Worth has done just that ... Worth narrows the field of view  using personal narratives to illuminate the larger dynamics. This is a common technique  but Mr Worth does it better than most. Economist It would be hard to find a more astute and eloquent guide to this explosive corner of the Earth than Robert F. Worth. He somehow managed to be on hand for a score of crucial moments in the Arab world's great convulsions  from the vast demonstrations of Tahrir Square to a just-liberated Libyan prison to the crushing of great hopes in the years that followed. Whatever lies ahead  I suspect that  as with John Reed's reporting on the Russian Revolution  people will be reading this vivid eyewitness account for years to come. -- Adam Hochschild  author of Spain in Our Hearts and To End All Wars. This is the book you have to read on the Middle East - not just to understand the Arab revolutions  but to feel them as human drama and tragedy. Robert Worth is a master who writes journalism as literature and history. -- George Packer  author of The Assassins' Gate and The Unwinding Worth ... draws on his intimate knowledge of the Middle East to offer a penetrating  unsettling analysis ... Informing the vivid narrative are many revealing interviews as well as the author's own eyewitness accounts of events. A crucial portrait of a deeply troubled region. Kirkus Reviews (starred review) Worth utilizes his long experience in the Middle East to provide a riveting survey of the origins  course of events  and causes of the dashing of so many of the dreams fueling the uprisings. He concentrates on Egypt  Libya  Syria  Yemen  and Tunisia  and he effectively combines his personal observations with the experience of participants. The result is an informative  if often heartrending  account of events whose consequences are still unfolding. Booklist The Arab world is in the grip of unprecedented crisis. Popular uprisings have weakened not just authoritarian rulers but the region's very foundations of security and stability. In his gripping account Robert Worth narrates the reversal in the Arab World's fortunes. First hand accounts  brimming with detail  unveil why the region rose up against dictatorship and then why it was not able to sustain democracy. Well-written and informative  A Rage for Order is an eye-opening read for policy-makers and anyone else interested in understanding the raging crisis in the Middle East. -- Vali Nasr  author The Dispensable Nation and The Shia Revival Robert Worth's A Rage for Order is a deeply informed and moving account of the politics of the Arab world during  and since  the Arab Spring uprisings of 2010. It is beautifully written and describes the tragedies and aspirations of the Arabs struggling under the yoke of authoritarian oppression and corrosive venality. Drawing on a deep understanding of language  culture and history  Worth provides a series of finely delineated portraits  bringing to life the struggles of individual men and women in Tunisia  Libya  Egypt  Syria  and Yemen. There is simply no better account of the recent events that have convulsed the countries of North African and the Middle East. -- Bernard A. Haykel  Professor of Near Eastern Studies and Director of the Institute for Transregional Study of the Contemporary Middle East  North Africa  and Central Asia at Princeton University A Rage for Order is an outstanding book that captures the high hopes and deep despair of average Arabs who lived through the revolutions of 2011 in Egypt  Libya  Syria and Yemen - and their tragic aftermath. This is a brilliant contemporary history by one of The United States' most distinguished Mideast correspondents  and a compellingly readable account. -- Eugene Rogan  author of The Arabs and The Fall of the Ottomans Worth traces the 'Arab Spring' through five countries  from the heady idealism of 2011 to the largely grim aftermath. Significantly  he does so through the stories of individuals rather than groups or sects  challenging simplistic  monolithic conceptions of rival factions ... Worth provides no easy path forward. Instead  he skillfully presents the competing perspectives in play to explain the daunting impediments to stable states in the present-day Middle East Publishers Weekly (starred review) What [Worth] accomplishes in A Rage for Order is to repaint some of those faces lost among the bloody coverage of warfare and tub-thumping rhetoric ... it's the individual stories which give the book its impact Stuff.co.nz [Worth] maps the transformative moments of the Arab revolutions  starting from Egypt  moving through Libya  Syria  Yemen and Tunisia ... [he] is adept at explaining genealogical histories and deftly melds them with people's stories Australian 				    	 					 About the Author Robert F.

A History of God: The 4 000-Year Quest of Judaism  Christianity and Islam Amazon.com Review Armstrong  a British journalist and former nun  guides us along one of the most elusive and fascinating quests of all time--the search for God. Like all beloved historians  Armstrong entertains us with deft storytelling  astounding research  and makes us feel a greater appreciation for the present because we better understand our past. Be warned: A History of God is not a tidy linear history. Rather  we learn that the definition of God is constantly being repeated  altered  discarded  and resurrected through the ages  responding to its followers' practical concerns rather than to mystical mandates. Armstrong also shows us how Judaism  Christianity  and Islam have overlapped and influenced one another  gently challenging the secularist history of each of these religions. --Gail Hudson  Review “An admirable and impressive work of synthesis that will give insight and satisfaction to thousands of lay readers.”—The Washington Post Book World“A brilliantly lucid  spendidly readable book. [Karen] Armstrong has a dazzling ability: she can take a long and complex subject and reduce it to the fundamentals  without oversimplifying.”—The Sunday Times (London)“Absorbing . . .

""This is one of the funniest joke book I've ever read. It's definitely is the funniest golf joke book I've ever read. It's in my top five joke books."" ""Great book and I've told some of the jokes in mixed company and men and women laugh hard and loud."" ""Probably the best golf joke book on the market today."" ""Great book! Bill Murray quoted in it: The more relaxed you are  the better you are at everything  the better you are with your loved ones  the better you are with your enemies  the better you are with your job  the better you are with yourself."" This book will make you laugh and relaxed. I enjoyed golf quotes  ""I have to drink it slowly and not out of a can. I need some ice. I use to have 26-28 cans a day.

About the Author We've played golf all our lives and got tired of hearing the same golf jokes so decided to create something refreshing for a laugh on the course or at the clubhouse bar. We along with thousands of others who socially and for business play golf  believe taking golf too seriously may lead to disaster on the course as well as business relationships. We agree with the words of Arthur Daley  ""Golf is like a love affair. If you don't take it seriously  it's no fun  if you take it seriously  it will break your heart."" So The Team created this joke book to help you relax  have fun and build better business relationships. It's a winner and helps all have fun and relax during a round. Good jokes help you relax - as comedian Bill Murray points out  ""The more relaxed you are  the better you are at everything: the better you are with your loved ones  the better you are with your enemies  the better you are at your job  the better you are with yourself."" Keep it in your bag and pull it out during delays on the course or in the clubhouse bar after a round  or anytime if you need a laugh. www.golfwell.net"
The Theory of Everything: The Origin and Fate of the Universe From AudioFile Physicist Stephen Hawking suffers from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis  also known as Lou Gehrig's disease. The condition has progressed to the point where he can no longer speak for himself. Hawking  therefore  uses a voice synthesizer to deliver this series of popular lectures on black holes  current physics theories  and the nature of time and space. The synthesizer paces sentences oddly and slurs an occasional word  Hawking jokes about being unable to get rid of its American accent. However  listeners will soon adapt to the oddities of delivery  and once they do  will find themselves inspired by the sweep and clarity of Hawking's mind  and by his warmth and bravery.

"The Patient Will See You Now Review ""In his new book  The Patient Will See You Now  Topol expertly builds upon his earlier path-finding work and explores how smartphone adoption  big data  new digital monitors of medically relevant information streams  ubiquitous computing  and larger networks are all combining to revolutionize health care far beyond what most now expect-with the exciting promise of lower costs and higher quality simultaneously. Coming from a world-class physician with a unique perspective on the rapidly changing nature of medicine  Topol's prescription for patient empowerment is a must read.""-Al Gore""Dr. Eric Topol is uniquely positioned to map out a new era of democratized medicine-a time when each individual will not only have immediate access to all of their own medical data  but even generate much of it and play a principal role in their healthcare."" -Sanjay Gupta  M.D. ""Dr. Eric Topol is a pioneer of the medicine of the future and the future is now! Read this book and empower yourself for total well-being."" -Deepak Chopra""Eric Topol has written a must-read manifesto for patients who feel helpless. Filled with knowledge and engaging stories  this book shows how you can harness technology to be the master of your medical care-or at least  a better partner for your doctor. I want Dr. Topol for my doctor."" -Elisabeth Rosenthal  M.D.  The New York Times""[A] groundbreaking book.... I think this book is revelatory and just plain smart.""-Jim Cramer  CNBC's Mad Money""[Topol is] one of medicine's most innovative thinkers about the digital future.... [A] valuable contribution to a fascinating subject. Despite his digital predilections  Topol is a humane and sympathetic observer of the plight of patients in our highly dysfunctional health care system. We can only hope mobile devices will help them better navigate (or scroll) their way through this perilous terrain.""-New York Times Book Review""Dr. Eric Topol [is] one of the nation's leading thinkers on the future of medicine.""-Newt Gingrich  Newsmax""Dr. Topol's overriding thesis is that the old days of 'doctor knows best' are as good as gone. No longer will doctors control medical data  treatment or profits. Instead  thanks to the newest science  humanity will finally achieve truly democratic health care.""-New York Times""The Patient Will See You Now is full of innovative thinking.... This book is full of technical wizardry and intriguing questions about the nature - and the future - of diagnosing  monitoring and healing.""-Perri Klass  Washington Post""In The Patient Will See You Now  Eric Topol charts how digitisation is slowly transforming medicine. Most industries have already been digitised--the media  music  banking--but perhaps the most important transformation will be in medicine  which still resembles something from the middle ages. Your mobile phone  for example  will analyse your heart beat for possible heart disease. Your DNA will be used to create new therapies and cures. The 'tricorder' of Star Trek  which analyses your health by simply scanning your body  is coming.""-Michio Kaku  The Guardian""[Dr. Topol's] vision is compelling  combining an empowering view of technology with the recognition that medicine requires something more. The best physicians heal even when they can't cure  Dr. Topol notes  and 'there will never be algorithms  supercomputers  avatars or robots to pull that off.'""-Wall Street Journal""[Topol] does a terrific job of laying out the immense potential of smartphones and iMedicine technologies to democratize medicine like never before.... Topol's writing style makes it very accessible for the lay person without any 'dumbing down' that would be a turnoff to health professionals. This is a must read for anyone that cares about healthcare.... I can't think of a book that does a better job of projecting how the future of medicine will unfold and the critical role individuals will play in their own health (beyond the obvious).""-Dave Chase  Forbes.com""It is rare to find a book that addresses quite technical topics so clearly  while interweaving stories about the variety of personalities who are shaping the field.... The book is both scholarly  supported by careful footnoting  and encyclopedic-nearly every recent development challenging traditional notions of medicine is carefully evaluated.""-Health Affairs""The mantra defining the future of medicine  according to physician and author Eric Topol  is 'Nothing about me without me.' And in his new work  The Patient Will See You Now  that mantra animates a vision of medicine that  in everyday practice  is radically democratized and digitized  made accessible and dialogic through the use of handheld devices  open-access records  iDocs  physician avatars and more.""-The Plain Dealer""[E]xtraordinarily thought-provoking and even provocative.... [T]he world [Topol] envisions is already exceedingly close to being realized  the writing on the wall is clear  unambiguous and unmistakable.

[He] foresees a future medical world profoundly bolstered by wireless Internet  where 'each individual will have all their own medical data and the computing power to process it.'""-Booklist""A visionary physician predicts a technology-driven  patient-centered revolution in health care. In this work about the changes afoot in the world of medical care  Topol  in this natural follow-up to his previous book  demonstrates the combination of intelligence and ambition that is apparent in his successful medical career.... Not content to simply critique the current system (though he does so thoroughly and convincingly)  the author strides optimistically into the future of health care.... An expertly detailed  precisely documented exploration of the 'power of information and individualization' in health care.""-Kirkus Reviews""In The Patient Will See You Now  Eric Topol unveils a visionary new world of patient empowerment through apps.""-The Independent (UK)""[Topol] envisions a new era where we could have...access to our own medical data and the tools to heal ourselves without being completely at the mercy of our doctors.... With an impressively well-researched cache of examples  he explains the various gadgets attached to smartphones to carry out complex medical examinations that cost pennies  the potential for using the same cheap technology in poor countries where expensive medical equipment cannot be deployed and the potential for the opening up of patient data - which could then be shared across the world through the Internet to find diagnoses and trends on an unprecedented scale.""-Winnipeg Free Press (Canada)""In this extraordinary book  Topol has  in effect  provided us with a prescription for the future of medicine. He outlines the challenges of the current practice of medicine  and gives us a powerful vision of what can be changed-and how. Topol writes about the future more effectively than any physician or scientist that I know. If you want to know about what medicine looks like today  you should read this book. But if you want to know what medicine will look like tomorrow  then you must absolutely read this book."" -Siddharta Muhkerjee  M.D.  author of The Emperor of All Maladies: A Biography of Cancer""Eric Topol understands better than anybody else the growing battle between technology- and information-empowered patients on one side  and the incumbent medical establishment on the other. He also understands who should win it. Read this book and you'll join him in fighting the good fight.""-Andrew McAfee  author of The Second Machine Age""Dr. Topol clearly captures the challenges and major disruptions occurring in medicine today.

He is the author of a number of bestsellers  including How to Master the Art of Selling  The Certifiable Salesperson  and Selling for Dummies. 				    	 					 Excerpt. © Reprinted by permission. All rights reserved. Introduction Welcome to the wonderful world of real estate! I began my career in real estate in the 1960s. It was wonderful then and has evolved into something even more wonderful today. What a joy it is for people to own real propertyùto have a place they can truly call home. And you get to delight in helping people achieve their dreams of home ownership  while earning a good income for yourself and your loved ones. ItÆs a truly satisfying career choice. Back in the 60s  real estate was primarily an older manÆs business. There were few young men choosing real estate as a career and even fewer women.  Fortunately for all of us  times have changed. I know of some young people these days who got their real estate licenses while still in high school and had a jump start on their careers on graduation day! Due to its flexibility of working hours  the field has provided excellent opportunities for thousands. IÆve seen many exciting changes over the years and congratulate you on your choice of a career in real estate.  When I wrote the first version of this material  it was actually two separate books. One just covered the listing aspect of real estate. The other  selling. They were first printed in the 1980sù back before computers  wireless phones  pagers  and the Internet. You are so fortunate today. Much of the research you need to do is available with the click of a few keysùand in minutes. I used to invest hours in researching data for Comparable Market Analyses  and reading through the Multiple Listing Service book (yes  it was a book  back then).  While the times have changed  some important aspects of buying and selling real estate have not. These include: the reasons people need your services  motivations for wanting a particular type of home  how husbands and wives relate to each other during real estate transactions  and how you must relate to them. ThatÆs the power of this book. In it are step-by-step strategies for getting started in this business  for finding people who need your services  for helping them like and trust you and your expertise in the field  how to prepare for a listing presentation  what to expect from potential buyers  what to say when they give you the most common questions or objections  how to negotiate offers and counteroffers  and how to close people on either listing their property with you or buying the home youÆve helped them find that best suits their needs.  In this revised edition  I have kept the best of the original books  deleted old strategies that may not be as effective today as they once were  and have added strategies that work phenomenally well in todayÆs marketplace. I cover the use of technology to save you time and increase your appearance of competence with clients. This book is designed to help you achieve a certain level of comfort within the real estate industryùbeing comfortable with the knowledge of what to expect and how to succeed in this truly wonderful career. Treat it as a textbook. Read it with a highlighter  a pen  and a notebook. Let it become your quick reference guide and your study guide as you grow. There is enough material here to help you through many years in this business. And  to help you find the success you dream of more quickly than you would without it. My wish for you is to find as much joy and satisfaction from your real estate career as I did mine.  MASTERING THE ART OF SELLING REAL ESTATE  Chapter 1 Portrait of a Professional  Real Estate Salesperson If you are reading this book  you may already have had a day that stands out as your worst day in real estate. If youÆre new to the business and havenÆt had such a day  donÆt worry  you will. Just donÆt let it deter you. Perseverance has made all the difference in my life.  My worst day is one I will always remember. I was new to real estate  nineteen years old  and I didnÆt own a suit. So  I wore my black and silver high school band uniform to work. My car was a beat-up  old convertible with holes in the roof and springs popping through the back seat. Needless to say  I didnÆt present the most professional image.  Like most new licensees  I didnÆt know what to do with myself. The training program in my office consisted of the sales manager giving me the thumbs up signal and telling me to ôhang in there.ö I was warm and friendly with all my prospects  but didnÆt know how to close a sale. In fact  I was so nice that sometimes when people didnÆt buy from me  they would send apologetic notes to my broker  saying how nice I was.  Until I discovered that there was such a thing as sales training  my earnings averaged $42 per month. That was for my first six months! It doesnÆt matter how you budgeted  even in the early 1960s  $42 a month didnÆt make it.  My enthusiasm was beginning to fade. In fact  there was a low period during which I decided real estate wasnÆt for me. Three sales had fallen out in one week. One day I walked into my brokerÆs office and said  ôIÆm thinking about quitting.ö He had no answer for meùthe thumbs up signal wasnÆt good enough anymore.  I was so depressed that I went back to my desk and started looking at the classifieds. Then the telephone rang. To my surprise  through the receiver came  without a doubt  the most beautiful voice I have ever heard. It was an absolute melody. She said something that I had never heard before. ôSir  my husband and I would like to buy a home.ö I thought someone was playing a joke on me. Then  she said  ôSir  weÆd like to spend around $200 000.ö This really shook me up because the area I worked in was Simi Valley  California  and then the average home sold for between $18 000 and $20 000.  I felt like saying  ôMaÆam  would you like half of the valley  a quarter of the valley  or what?ö I didnÆt though. Somehow I kept my composure and set an appointment for 2:00 p.m. that day. To say I was nervous after this phone call would be a terrible understatement. I didnÆt even know of a home that was worth that much in Simi Valley. After driving around for a few hours  I finally found the right home on the top of a hill. It was absolutely perfect! It had a phenomenal view. It was a $187 000 mansion. My career finally looked like it was turning around.  On the way back to the office  they announced on the radio that it was the hottest day of the yearù105 degrees  75 percent humidity. I didnÆt care  though. My enthusiasm was zooming off the charts! Back in the office  I pulled out a piece of paper  like any starving real estate person  and figured out what 6 percent of $187 000 was. People around me could hear me say  ôAll right! IÆm going to make some big money here!ö  Right at 2:00 p.m.  in walked this gorgeous creature. She had on a $300 outfit and diamonds everywhere. Her hair was beautifully styled  her makeup exquisite. It must have taken at least two hours to put it on. I jumped up to meet her.  Being such a nervous wreck  I donÆt even remember how I got her into my car. As we drove down the street  I couldnÆt think of a thing to say to her. I was embarrassed by my car and nervous about the possibility of selling such a high-priced property.  All of a sudden  my car started to jerk. In my excitement about finding the right home  I had forgotten to check my gas tank. It was empty! Rolling the car to a stop at the side of the road  I turned to my potential new client and said  ôMaÆam  IÆve never had anything like this happen before. Please forgive me. ThereÆs a gas station only half a mile away. IÆll be right back.ö  There I was in my newly dry-cleaned  wool band uniform jogging down the street with my gas can. I wish you could have been there when I got back to that car. Not only was I a sweaty wreck  the woman had sat in that closed car at 105 degrees the whole time I was gone. Everything that had been on her face was now on her chest. Her hair even looked like it was melting. ôMaÆam  IÆm so sorry ö I said. ôIÆve never had this happen. You can have all the air.ö I turned all the vents on her and drove on to the house.  By the time we got to the house  I had decided nothing could be worse than selling real estate as a career. Trying to regain my composure  I thought IÆd show her the beautiful view from the patio. She would have to be impressed with it and might forget what had happened with the car.  Walking over to the sliding door  I said  ôMaÆam  I think youÆll enjoy this view.ö I held the curtain back for her to see it. Well  she thought the sliding glass door was open and walked right into it. She hit her head hard and was obviously stunned. She looked at me for a split second with an expression I cannot describe and ran to lock herself in the bathroom.  Luckily  the sellers were gone. But now I had to get her out of the bathroom. I began knocking on the door  pleading with her to come out. Upon hearing a noise behind me  I turned to see that the sellers had returned ahead of schedule. Needless to say  they wanted to know what was going on. With the help of the sellers  the lady came out of the bathroom  and I got her back to my car. Not a word was spoken on the trip back to the office. When we got there  like a zombie  she got out of my car  walked to hers  and drove away.  I went into the office and took some aspirin. This was definitely the end of my real estate career. Nothing could be worse than what IÆd just gone through. Out came the classifieds again. Then  there was a phone call for me. When I answered  the man on the other end said  ôYes  Mr. Hopkins  you just showed my wife a home. I just canÆt believe what sheÆs told me. I want to see it  too.ö I felt like fainting dead on the spot!  They were both coming to the office right then. This time I had a goal for when they arrived. My goal was to get them from the front door to my desk without incident.  Now  there are certain types of people that we instantly likeùpeople we can build a rapport with very quickly. This ladyÆs husband was one of those types for me. After a few minutes  he and I were talking easily and getting along really well. All the while  his wife watched us both very carefully.  All of a sudden  this horsefly flew by. We had each shooed it away a couple of times during our conversation. This time  though  as a joke  I reached out for the fly  acted like I had it  and popped it in my mouth. Much to my surprise  I really did have it! It was moving around in there.  Now  I could do one of two things. I could swallow it and say something like  ôMmm  we love them here!ö Or  I could spit it out. I chose the latter. When I looked up  that couple had this amazed look on their faces. The wife was nudging the husband with her elbow and saying  ôI told you so.ö  Needless to say  I didnÆt make that sale. In fact  a letter came from them a day later that said  ôBased on our short exposure to the people in Simi Valley  weÆre staying where we live!ö  Around that time  I found out there was such a thing as sales training. I invested my last $150 of savings on a seminar to learn how to sell. If that didnÆt work  I was going to quit for sure. I was amazed by the things I learned at that seminar. Now that I could see where IÆd been going wrong  I started getting my enthusiasm back. I took notes and memorized them until my brain ached. Once I was able to apply the material  I was thrilled with the results. My career really started turning around.  Hopefully  you will never have as terrible a day as I did. Unfortunately  some of your days may be just as bad or  even worse. WhatÆs important is to anticipate those days and learn in advance the best ways to handle them. YouÆve made the first important step just by picking up this book. By reading and internalizing this material  you can become more prepared to meet the daily challenges of a career in real estate and succeed.  As a real estate salesperson  you are paid in direct proportion to your ability to communicate with people and serve their needs. If you canÆt do that  youÆll go nowhere in this businessùfast. IÆm assuming youÆve already learned that lesson the hard way and thatÆs part of the reason why you are now reading this book. You want to learn how to become a real estate professional.  Every profession has certain tools  which  once mastered  will allow you the opportunity to become one of the great ones in that field. For example  a professional golfer is paid in direct proportion to his or her ability to take a piece of steel at the end of a stick and bring it down to touch a small  white ball at the right time and place to send it hundreds of yards  eventually dropping into a small hole. Someone like Tiger Woods is a very successful professional because he has mastered the use of his tools.  A professional fighter is paid for how well he uses his fists  a surgeonùa scalpel  a carpenter must master the use of saws  hammers  and power tools. The people in each of these lines of work develop their skills through years of study  practice  and experience before they consider themselves professionals. If theyÆre smart  they learn not only by their own experiences but through the experiences of others.  The same thing applies to you in real estate. You canÆt become a real estate professional without learning what one does  can you? My goal in this book is to make you realize that youÆre no different from any other professional. As a real estate agent  you must primarily learn how to use your eyes  ears  and mouth because one of your most important tools is your ability to create exciting  colorful images  thus leading people to the decision to own real estate.  You see  selling real estate is no different from any other profession. As I mentioned above  people in most professional fields are paid in direct proportion to the amount of service they give. You  as a real estate salesperson  are as professional as the income you earn. So  in other words  if youÆre not making enough money  youÆre not giving enough service.  To learn how to give more service  you must learn from a professionalùsomeone who has done what you want to do: real estate. The problem with too many people is that they are taking advice or ôtrainingö from people who are not professionals. How can they teach you something theyÆve never accomplished themselves? Why would you want to learn from someone whoÆs not a top producer? IÆm not saying you canÆt learn from someone else  but be aware that you are limited to their experience. If theyÆre already way ahead of you because youÆre new  go ahead and let them help you. However  once you begin to master what they teach  youÆll likely find yourself needing to learn from someone who is better at this businessùthat is if you plan to achieve the most you can from it.  You might be concerned about how well youÆll do in this business because youÆre not a natural born salesperson. You just donÆt have that gift of gab. Trust me  thereÆs no such thing as a natural born salesperson. All youÆre doing if you accept that myth is keeping yourself from achieving your true potential. We all start out with pretty much the same abilities. ItÆs what we do with them along the way that counts. In other words  great salespeople are not born  theyÆre trained. If you love the idea of helping people sell their homes and find new ones that are just right for them  youÆll do well. The first key to success in any sales position is that you must be enthusiastic about your product. Everything else can be learned.  You have the ability right now to learn what it takes to become one of the top salespeople the real estate business has ever known. You just have to be willing to change and grow beyond who you are now. Begin by finding successful people and surrounding yourself with them. Be with the people whom youÆd most like to become. If you want to be average  then stick with average people. If itÆs your desire to achieve greatness in real estate sales  then learn what the great ones do  and do it! What Is a Professional Salesperson? A professional salesperson is a person who earns more money than the average salesperson. If you are not earning two to three times more income than the average real estate salesperson  you are not as professional as you could be. If you are unwilling to make the changes necessary to achieve this level of professionalism  you should consider getting a job where someone pays you a salary.  In a salaried position  you have a lot of security. However  you also have someone else determining exactly how much money you will make. In most cases  that person is going to be working too hard at becoming rich to worry about whether or not you do.  The exciting thing about real estate is that you can get rich helping other people to get rich. You see  the people who own the real estate have more than you do. You get your brokerage  but they get to keep the real estate  the value of which is going up faster than inflation. So  theyÆre hedging inflation  building equity  sheltering income  and building estatesùall because of youùthe professional real estate salesperson.  I hope you want to become rich. You may not realize it  but there are people who donÆt want to be rich. Maybe there are some in your officeùpeople who are literally afraid of success. You hear them say things like this: ôI donÆt want to be rich. Rich men are sick men.ö  Believe me  I know a lot of healthy  wealthy people.  ôMoney isnÆt important.ö  It isnÆt. Unless you donÆt have any.  Money is the by-product of the service you render to other people. If you give no service  you get no money. When you give lots of excellent service  you get lots of money.  It is important you realize that when I say the word rich  I mean the fully matured  happy  and successful human being  who is striving to get rich in all areas of his or her life. A truly successful life has much more to it than money.  LetÆs break the term rich down into four key areas: 1. EMOTIONAL RICHES. This means coping with lifeÆs daily challenges and crises. It includes keeping a balance in life between business and family priorities. DonÆt booby-trap yourself into thinking that you could or should be happy all of the time. Things happen in everyoneÆs lives that make them unhappy. ItÆs how you handle those things that will matter in the long run. Experience everything life has to offer  but determine that you will pick yourself up after every downer  learn from it  and get back to being happy the rest of the time.  I know this may sound simplified. ThereÆs much more to it that I just canÆt cover in this book. For more help in this area  you might consider my book  The Official Guide to Success and audio series titled Balance Your Life. 2. FINANCIAL RICHES. My definition of financial wealth is the ability to live comfortably  that means debt-free  off the monthly income generated by your net worth at a given date and time using the talents God has given you to be productive.  Earning a high income is truly possible in this business. What you do with that money after you earn it determines how financially rich you become. Be money smart. It pays! 3. PHYSICAL RICHES. This means taking care of your body through exercise and proper eating habits and striving to live a long  healthy life overall. If you have a challenge with smoking  alcohol  or drugs of any sortù legal or illegalùset a goal to become free of the habit. Then seek out the best help you can find to start working toward that goal. 4. SPIRITUAL RICHES. I strongly believe in the importance of having a satisfactory personal relationship with God  and that it has helped me achieve professional success. One thing I know is true. I was fortunate at a young age to achieve what most people consider material success and I can honestly tell you that things donÆt make you happy once you have them. It is spiritual satisfaction  balanced with material gain  that brings total fulfillment.  It seems that too often today we see people who want more for less. Sure  they want more. DoesnÆt everybody? But  they also want to know how they can get it the easy way.  Fifty years ago in America people thought differently. They wanted more  but they also understood that to get it  they would have to give more  to work harder  to work smarter. By understanding what people did fifty years ago  you and I have the opportunity to get rich today. Common Characteristics of the Pros There are many characteristics common to real estate professionals. To become more professional  adopt these traits. If you already have them  good for you. Consider what it would take to improve them.  One particular quality that separates the average from the great can be expressed by one simple wordùdesire. Most of the great ones have an overwhelming desire to prove something to someone. They know they can be the best in their field and are out to prove it to the world  or maybe just to themselves and their families. This desire burns so strongly within them that it keeps them moving in the right direction. It keeps them cheerful with their clients and fellow salespeople. ItÆs the fuel that keeps their engines running in top condition.  Now  I canÆt tell how much desire you have to make it in this field. Only you know that. The question is how much stress  anxiety  and pain can you handle before you quit? Do you have a low threshold for rejection? Think about what youÆre willing to give or do to achieve what you really want. Can you accept ten or twenty nos in order to get the one yes that earns you a big fee? If youÆre not sure  consider looking at it differently. Take the ten nos and divide them into one fee youÆll receive from a listing sold or a sale you make yourself.  For example  letÆs say you end up with $5 000 in your personal bank account after a sale. And  letÆs say you were rejected in some way or another by ten people before making that sale. That makes each no you received worth $500 to you. Each no brought you $500 closer to the final yes and your fee.  Selling is a game. You must make a game of the negative aspects of it in order to be a winner in the long run. Learn ways to brush off the negatives  the rejection  and the canceled sales in order to stay focused on the gold ringùthe closed sale that does eventually come about if you stick with it. ThatÆs how to increase your desire to succeed in this business.  Professionals pay close attention to details. They ask questions that help them get a better understanding of what their clients are looking for in a home. They have their paperwork in order. They return phone calls promptly. They keep their promises and have answers ready when questions are asked.  Professionals are highly goal-oriented. They strive for a certain number of homes listed and sold each month  a certain income  a trophy  or an award. They know exactly what theyÆre working for and when theyÆll achieve it.  Do you have your goals in writing? If not  you are a wisher and a dreamer. You havenÆt really committed yourself to achieving anything. YouÆre like those average people in your office who say  ôSure  I want to make more money  but after the day I had yesterday  IÆm not leaving the office today.ö  You see  the successful ones  the true professionals  begin where the failures stop. They do what the failures are afraid or too lazy to do.  The great ones understand that they must strive daily to improve their skills. I hope youÆre not one of those people who says  ôIf I donÆt make it at this  I can always ...ö ThatÆs a plan for failure. If you anticipate it  you will probably get it. Instead  be one of the great ones who says  ôIf I donÆt do well enough this time  next time  IÆll try ______ to do it better.ö Have a plan for success instead of one for failure.  Top professionals in real estate give excellent service. They know they are paid in direct proportion to the amount of service they give their clients. They understand they are in the people business. They donÆt sell homes. They get people happily involved in owning property by satisfying their real estate needs. Steps to Professionalism There are ten basic  overall steps to professionalism IÆd like to share with you. Follow them and you will be able to achieve the level of success you desire. STEP 1. Professionals keep a positive attitude when the world crumbles around them. A little bit of the world crumbles around each of us at times  and we must learn to anticipate it. If you allow lifeÆs challenges to get you down  you wonÆt be ready for the next positive thing that happens to you  and you just might miss a fantastic opportunity. STEP 2. Professionals have a certain look about them. WhatÆs your vision of what a professional real estate salesperson looks like? Envision every detail from the hairstyle down to the shoes. Now  look at yourself in a mirror. Do any of the details in your ideal picture fit you? If not  maybe itÆs time to make some changes. Start with minor changes and watch yourself grow into that professional image you have in mind. STEP 3. Customers and clients relate business success with competence. A professional surrounds himself or herself with images of success. Do your car  briefcase  desk  and office communicate a successful business career? STEP 4. Organization is an important image to clients. This means being on time  having answers ready  handling details  and following up diligently. All these things tell people that you are a person worthy of their confidence. How organized are you? STEP 5. Talk like a professional. Avoid shop talk at all costs. Ask questions about your clients. You must show an interest in them and their needs to get them to open up to you. Choose your words carefully so as not to offend. Plan your presentation from your prospectÆs point of view. STEP 6. Stay in tune. The real estate profession is constantly changing. Devote a regular part of your week to learning of new developments in the field and sharpening your skills. STEP 7. Respect your fellow salespeople. Others in this profession have the same challenges you have. They deserve the same credit and recognition when they succeed and the same help and encouragement when they fail. Everyone wins when the team gets stronger. STEP 8. Remember your family and friends. They want and need a high-quality relationship. Be sure to plan time for family and social needs. It will help you gain their understanding when business takes you away evenings and weekends. STEP 9. See the people. There are literally thousands of people in your area who need and deserve professional assistance with their real estate needs. If you donÆt take it to them  they might be shortchanged by someone less professional. The more people you meet  the more you can serve. STEP 10. Keep your integrity intact. Almost every day an opportunity to take unfair advantage of someone arises. A professional knows that a dissatisfied customer today will cost him or her several possible transactions in the future. A professional knows how important selling with the facts is. Stretching the truth  omitting information  and avoiding present problems by stalling or blaming someone else is for amateurs. Sell with the facts  and you only have to sell them once. If youÆll use these ten steps as a guideline  when someone asks what you do for a living  you can say: I am a real estate professional!"""

"The Unwomanly Face of War (Penguin Modern Classics) Review Extraordinary. . . it would be hard to find a book that feels more important or original. . . Alexievich's strength - and a mark of her own courage - is that she is forever on the lookout for the seemingly inconsequential  almost trivial human moments. . . Her achievement is as breathtaking as the experiences of these women are awe-inspiring (Viv Groskop Observer)An astonishing book  harrowing and life-affirming. It deserves the widest possible readership (Paula Hawkins  author of The Girl on the Train)Magnificent. . . Alexievich doesn't just hear what these women say  she cares about how they speak. . . It's a mark of her exceptional mind that she tries to retain the incomprehensible in any human story (Gaby Wood Daily Telegraph Books of the Year)A must read (Margaret Atwood)Brilliant (Kamila Shamsie Guardian Books of the Year)A revelation. . . Alexievich's text gives us precious details of the kind that breathe life into history . . . This is a book about emotions as much as it is about facts. It is not a historical document in the accepted sense. . . and yet ultimately  which historical documents are more important than this? (Lyuba Vinogradova Financial Times)Astonishing. . . Her years of meticulous listening  her unobtrusiveness and her ear for the telling detail and the memorable story have made her an exceptional witness to modern times. . . This is oral history at its finest and it is also an essay on the power of memory  on what is remembered and what is forgotten (Caroline Moorehead Guardian)These stories about the women warriors of Mother Russia are a symphony of feminine suffering and strength. . . Read this book. And then read it again (Gerard DeGroot The Times) 				    	 					 About the Author Svetlana Alexievich (Author)  Svetlana Alexievich was born in Ivano-Frankivsk in 1948 and has spent most of her life in the Soviet Union and present-day Belarus  with prolonged periods of exile in Western Europe.

"What If? Review With this book and with XKCD  you're a kid with a chemistry set all over again. [Randall Munroe's] enthusiasm for all things scientific is infectious . . . required reading for grown-ups  it's just fun to remember that science is really  really coolSmart answers to silly questions: Randall Munroe reveals allWhat If? maintains a delightfully free-wheeling tone throughout  especially when complicated calculations lead to whimsical results. Despite all the hard facts and gigantic numbers  it never feels like a textbook-and you don't have to be a rocket scientist to enjoy itThe best bathroom book you'll ever buy...Munroe takes inane  useless and often quite pointless questions asked by real humans (mostly sent to him through his website)  and turns them into beautiful expositions on the impossible that illuminate the furthest reaches  almost to the limits  of the modern sciences .The first chapter  ""Q. What would happen if the Earth and all terrestrial objects suddenly stopped spinning  but the atmosphere retained its velocity?"" ends with the anthropomorphized moon worrying over the state of the Earth  and  with the gravity generated by its own rotation around the Earth  saving our dying planet. The physics are real  so is the emotional content. . . The answers are all illustrated with xkcd's trademark stick figures.. . . . and these are eminently approachableBrilliantWhat If? includes old favorites  new inquiries and the mix of expert research and accessible wit that has made Munroe a favorite among both geeks and laymenMunroe's brilliant What-If? column-which features scientifically rigorous  utterly absurd answers to ridiculous hypotheticals-has been on the bestseller lists since it was announced in March. Today  it hits shelves and: It. Is. A. Triumph[What If?] has solved my annual birthday-present and holiday-gift dilemmas for a large group of people . . . What makes Munroe's work so fantastic is a combination of two elements: his commitment to trying to answer even the weirdest question with solid science  and his undeniable sense of humour. So  here's a ""What If?"" from me: If everyone on the planet simultaneously bought a copy of this book  stopped what they were doing and read it cover to cover  would modern civilization and our global economy collapse? It's worth trying the experiment.For the record  I'm loving XKCD's What If -- 'Dear Abby for mad scientists'Munroe has hit on a wonderful form of science and engineering communication that can do so much-extolling the value of analytical thinking  examining data  and doing back-of-the-envelope calculations-while entertaining readers at the same time . . . an incredibly fun book with quirky  hand-drawn pictures 				    	 				        	--This text refers to the Kindle Edition edition. 				         					 Book Description Science's most intriguing questions answered by the web's favourite writer  the genius behind xkcd.com.Munroe's hilarious and compelling answers explain everything from the odds of meeting your one true soulmate to how many humans a rampaging T-Rex would need to eat a day. 				    	 				        	--This text refers to the Kindle Edition edition.

A Short Book of Public Health About the Author VK Muthu MBBS DPH MSc (Applied Nutrition).
Neuroscience Nursing: Assessment and Patient Management This book brings together the best of the neuroscience articles that have been published in the British Journal of Nursing since April 2004. Together they provide an essential reference for nurses working with people with neurological problems in a variety of settings from critical care and tertiary referral centres with specialist neuroscience units  through to stroke services and primary care teams. The book is divided into three sections. The first section focuses on aspects of assessment relevant to neurological patients  the second covers a variety of issues in the management of patients with acute neurological conditions  including some key aspects of neuroscience critical care practice  and the final section focuses on the management of patients with long-term neurological conditions. The aim of this book is to identify key areas of practice and evidence of current best care rather than to provide the definitive neuroscience nursing text. The fact that such a wide range of papers has been published over such a short space of time in one generic nursing journal is testament to the importance of the subject for all practising nurses. With over 10 million people in the UK suffering from a neurological problem one can see the need for nurses everywhere to have access to resources to help them understand and implement appropriate care for these patients.

"The Bell Curve: Intelligence and Class Structure in American Life (A Free Press Paperbacks Book) Review Michael Novak National Review Our intellectual landscape has been disrupted by the equivalent of an earthquake.David Brooks The Wall Street Journal Has already kicked up more reaction than any social?science book this decade.Peter Brimelow Forbes Long-awaited...massive  meticulous  minutely detailed  clear. Like Darwin's Origin of Species -- the intellectual event with which it is being seriously compared -- The Bell Curve offers a new synthesis of research...and a hypothesis of far-reaching explanatory power.Milton Friedman This brilliant  original  objective  and lucidly written book will force you to rethink your biases and prejudices about the role that individual difference in intelligence plays in our economy  our policy  and our society.Chester E. Finn  Jr. Commentary The Bell Curve's implications will be as profound for the beginning of the new century as Michael Harrington's discovery of ""the other America"" was for the final part of the old. Richard Herrnstein's bequest to us is a work of great value. Charles Murray's contribution goes on.Prof. Thomas J. Bouchard Contemporary Psychology [The authors] have been cast as racists and elitists and The Bell Curve has been dismissed as pseudoscience....The book's message cannot be dismissed so easily. Herrnstein and Murray have written one of the most provocative social science books published in many years....This is a superbly written and exceedingly well documented book.Christopher Caldwell American Spectator The Bell Curve is a comprehensive treatment of its subject never mean-spirited or gloating. It gives a fair hearing to those who dissent scientifically from its propositions -- in fact  it bends over backward to be fair....Among the dozens of hostile articles that have thus far appeared  none has successfully refuted any of its science.Malcolme W. Browne The New York Times Book Review Mr. Murray and Mr. Herrnstein write that ""for the last 30 years  the concept of intelligence has been a pariah in the world of ideas "" and that the time has come to rehabilitate rational discourse on the subject. It is hard to imagine a democratic society doing otherwise.Prof. Eugene D. Genovese National Review Richard Herrnstein and Charles Murray might not feel at home with Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Lani Guinier  but they should....They have all [made] brave attempts to force a national debate on urgent matters that will not go away. And they have met the same fate. Once again  academia and the mass media are straining every muscle to suppress debate.Prof. Earl Hunt American Scientist The first reactions to The Bell Curve were expressions of public outrage. In the second round of reaction  some commentators suggested that Herrnstein and Murray were merely bringing up facts that were well known in the scientific community  but perhaps best not discussed in public. A Papua New Guinea language has a term for this  Mokita. It means ""truth that we all know  but agree not to talk about."" ...There are fascinating questions here for those interested in the interactions between sociology  economics  anthropology and cognitive science. We do not have the answers yet. We may need them soon  for policy makers who rely on Mokita are flying blind. 				    	 					 About the Author Richard J.

"Master Dentistry: Volume 1: Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery  Radiology  Pathology and Oral Medicine Review ""This book encompasses four major disciplines of dentistry in 16 easy to read  well laid out chapters. Like the previous editions each chapter finishes of with a self-assessment section in the form MCQs  extended matching questions  case reports and oral exam questions to complement the setup of most undergraduate and post-graduate examinations. this section will be valuable to students as it offers them feedback on their performance in that particular subject or chapter. In opinion the oral medicine and pathology chapters excel in covering a topic most of us found challenging at undergraduate level...The broad coverage of topics within this edition will appeal to many students  however  this book should be viewed as a complement to existing textbooks and should not be seen as a replacement alternative. With that in mind  it will maintain itself as an invaluable study aid for many students and will find its place in many undergraduate and post-graduate students' bookshelves."" British Dental Journal  January 2014 ""The book provides a fantastic blend of core teaching and texts from the relevant disciplines  to allow students the opportunity to gain not only core knowledge but also the ability to approach clinical problem solving logically. The volume also conditions the student to make sensible  safe and informed decisions about patient management  not only for BDS/BChD/MFDS finals but also in the field of primary dental care. This knowledge  and informed decision making  not only aids the ability to rationalise clinical scenarios  but also promotes self appraisal and knowledge of when to refer to specialist colleagues.""  4th Year BDS Student  School of Dental Sciences  Newcastle University  The Master Dentistry series provides a good overview of the subject areas and I found them particularly useful during exam times. The text is appropriately supplemented with great diagrams and the layout of the books makes all the subject areas easy to access and find.   At the end of each chapter there are self assessment questions which were really useful and would aid any student's learning. Each chapter has a helpful overview and learning objectives are provided throughout each chapter.   The books give a great summary of all the subject areas they cover but need to be used in conjunction with a more detailed textbook.

Through the most riveting episodes  his compassionate character and quiet voice seemed personally to speak to me ...

He is a deal maker the way lions are carnivores and water is wet.”—Chicago Tribune   “Fascinating . . . wholly absorbing . . . conveys Trump’s larger-than-life demeanor so vibrantly that the reader’s attention is instantly and fully claimed.”—Boston Herald   “A chatty  generous  chutzpa-filled autobiography.”—New York Post  From the Inside Flap From the Impresario of NBC's hit show ""The Apprentice TRUMP ON TRUMP: ""I like thinking big. I always have. To me it's very simple: if you're going to be thinking anyway  you might as well think big."" And here's how he does it: the art of the deal. Beginning with a week in Trump's high-stakes life  ""Trump: The Art of the Deal gives us Trump in action. We see just how he operates day to day--how he runs his business and how he runs his life--as he chats with friends and family  clashes with enemies  efficiently buys up Atlantic City's top casinos  changes the face of the New York City skyline . . . and plans the tallest building in the world. TRUMP ON TRUMP: ""I play it very loose. I don't carry a briefcase. I try not to schedule too many meetings. I leave my door open. . . . I prefer to come to work each day and just see what develops."" Even a maverick plays by rules  and here Trump formulates his own eleven guidelines for success. He isolates the common elements in his greatest deals  he shatters myths (""You don't necessarily need the best location. What you need is the best deal"")  he names names  spells out the zeros  and fully reveals the deal-maker's art: from the abandoned property that became the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center to the seedy hotel that became the Grand Hyatt  from the race to rebuild Central Park's Wollman Skating Rink to the byzantine saga of the property that became Trump Tower. And throughout  Trump talks--""really talks--about how he does it. TRUMP ON TRUMP: ""I always go into a deal anticipating the worst. If you plan for the worst--if you can live with the worst--the good will always take care of itself."" Donald Trump is blunt  brash  surprisingly old-fashioned in spots--and always  always an original. ""Trump: The Art of the Deal is an unguarded look at the mind of a brilliant entrepreneur and an unprecedented education in the art of the deal. It's the most streetwise business book there is--and a sizzling read for anyone interested in money and success. 				    	 					              See all Product description"

"Nudge – Improving Decisions About Health  Wealth and Happiness Amazon.com Review    Questions for Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein     Amazon.com: What do you mean by ""nudge"" and why do people sometimes need to be nudged? Thaler and Sunstein: By a nudge we mean anything that influences our choices. A school cafeteria might try to nudge kids toward good diets by putting the healthiest foods at front. We think that it's time for institutions  including government  to become much more user-friendly by enlisting the science of choice to make life easier for people and by gentling nudging them in directions that will make their lives better. Amazon.com: What are some of the situations where nudges can make a difference?  Thaler and Sunstein: Well  to name just a few: better investments for everyone  more savings for retirement  less obesity  more charitable giving  a cleaner planet  and an improved educational system. We could easily make people both wealthier and healthier by devising friendlier choice environments  or architectures.  Amazon.com: Can you describe a nudge that is now being used successfully?  Thaler and Sunstein: One example is the Save More Tomorrow program. Firms offer employees who are not saving very much the option of joining a program in which their saving rates are automatically increased whenever the employee gets a raise. This plan has more than tripled saving rates in some firms  and is now offered by thousands of employers.  Amazon.com: What is ""choice architecture"" and how does it affect the average person's daily life? Thaler and Sunstein: Choice architecture is the context in which you make your choice. Suppose you go into a cafeteria. What do you see first  the salad bar or the burger and fries stand? Where's the chocolate cake? Where's the fruit? These features influence what you will choose to eat  so the person who decides how to display the food is the choice architect of the cafeteria. All of our choices are similarly influenced by choice architects. The architecture includes rules deciding what happens if you do nothing  what's said and what isn't said  what you see and what you don't. Doctors  employers  credit card companies  banks  and even parents are choice architects. We show that by carefully designing the choice architecture  we can make dramatic improvements in the decisions people make  without forcing anyone to do anything. For example  we can help people save more and invest better in their retirement plans  make better choices when picking a mortgage  save on their utility bills  and improve the environment simultaneously. Good choice architecture can even improve the process of getting a divorce--or (a happier thought) getting married in the first place!  Amazon.com: You are very adamant about allowing people to have choice  even though they may make bad ones. But if we know what's best for people  why just nudge? Why not push and shove? Thaler and Sunstein: Those who are in position to shape our decisions can overreach or make mistakes  and freedom of choice is a safeguard to that. One of our goals in writing this book is to show that it is possible to help people make better choices and retain or even expand freedom. If people have their own ideas about what to eat and drink  and how to invest their money  they should be allowed to do so.   Amazon.com: You point out that most people spend more time picking out a new TV or audio device than they do choosing their health plan or retirement investment strategy? Why do most people go into what you describe as ""auto-pilot mode"" even when it comes to making important long-term decisions? Thaler and Sunstein: There are three factors at work. First  people procrastinate  especially when a decision is hard. And having too many choices can create an information overload. Research shows that in many situations people will just delay making a choice altogether if they can (say by not joining their 401(k) plan)  or will just take the easy way out by selecting the default option  or the one that is being suggested by a pushy salesman.  Second  our world has gotten a lot more complicated. Thirty years ago most mortgages were of the 30-year fixed-rate variety making them easy to compare. Now mortgages come in dozens of varieties  and even finance professors can have trouble figuring out which one is best. Since the cost of figuring out which one is best is so hard  an unscrupulous mortgage broker can easily push unsophisticated borrowers into taking a bad deal.  Third  although one might think that high stakes would make people pay more attention  instead it can just make people tense. In such situations some people react by curling into a ball and thinking  well  err  I'll do something else instead  like stare at the television or think about baseball. So  much of our lives is lived on auto-pilot  just because weighing complicated decisions is not so easy  and sometimes not so fun. Nudges can help ensure that even when we're on auto-pilot  or unwilling to make a hard choice  the deck is stacked in our favor. Amazon.com: Are we humans just poorly adapted for making sound judgments in an increasingly fast-paced and complex world? What can we do to position ourselves better?  Thaler and Sunstein: The human brain is amazing  but it evolved for specific purposes  such as avoiding predators and finding food. Those purposes do not include choosing good credit card plans  reducing harmful pollution  avoiding fatty foods  and planning for a decade or so from now. Fortunately  a few nudges can help a lot. A few small hints: Sign up for automatic payment plans so you dont pay late fees. Stop using your credit cards until you can pay them off on time every month. Make sure you're enrolled in a 401(k) plan. A final hint: Read Nudge.    Review ""How often do you read a book that is both important and amusing  both practical and deep? This gem of a book presents the best idea that has come out of behavioral economics. It is a must-read for anyone who wants to see both our minds and our society working better. It will improve your decisions and it will make the world a better place.""-Daniel Kahneman  Princeton University  Nobel Laureate in Economics (Daniel Kahneman )""In this utterly brilliant book  Thaler and Sunstein teach us how to steer people toward better health  sounder investments  and cleaner environments without depriving them of their inalienable right to make a mess of things if they want to. The inventor of behavioral economics and one of the nation''s best legal minds have produced the manifesto for a revolution in practice and policy. Nudge won''t nudge you-it will knock you off your feet.""-Daniel Gilbert  professor of psychology  Harvard University  Author of Stumbling on Happiness (Daniel Gilbert )""This is an engaging  informative  and thoroughly delightful book. Thaler and Sunstein provide important lessons for structuring social policies so that people still have complete choice over their own actions  but are gently nudged to do what is in their own best interests. Well done.""-Don Norman  Northwestern University  Author of The Design of Everyday Things and The Design of Future Things (Don Norman )""This book is terrific. It will change the way you think  not only about the world around you and some of its bigger problems  but also about yourself.""-Michael Lewis  author of The Blind Side: Evolution of a Game and Liar''s Poker (Michael Lewis )""Two University of Chicago professors sketch a new approach to public policy that takes into account the odd realities of human behavior  like the deep and unthinking tendency to conform. Even in areas-like energy consumption-where conformity is irrelevant. Thaler has documented the ways people act illogically.""-Barbara Kiviat  Time (Barbara Kiviat Time )""Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein''s Nudge is a wonderful book: more fun than any important book has a right to be-and yet it is truly both.""-Roger Lowenstein  author of When Genius Failed (Roger Lowenstein )""A manifesto for using the recent behavioral research to help people  as well as government agencies  companies and charities  make better decisions.""-David Leonhardt  The New York Times Magazine (David Leonhardt The New York Times Magazine )""I love this book. It is one of the few books I''ve read recently that fundamentally changes the way I think about the world. Just as surprising  it is fun to read  drawing on examples as far afield as urinals  401(k) plans  organ donations  and marriage. Academics aren''t supposed to be able to write this well.""-Steven Levitt  Alvin Baum Professor of Economics  University of Chicago Graduate School of Business and co-author of Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything (Steven Levitt )"

"America's War for the Greater Middle East Review “[Andrew J.] Bacevich is thought-provoking  profane and fearless. . . . [His] call for Americans to rethink their nation’s militarized approach to the Middle East is incisive  urgent and essential.”—The New York Times Book Review   “Bacevich’s magnum opus . . . a deft and rhythmic polemic aimed at America’s failures in the Middle East from the end of Jimmy Carter’s presidency to the present.”—Robert D. Kaplan  The Wall Street Journal  “A critical review of American policy and military involvement . . . Those familiar with Bacevich’s work will recognize the clarity of expression  the devastating directness and the coruscating wit that characterize the writing of one of the most articulate and incisive living critics of American foreign policy.”—The Washington Post “[A] monumental new work . . . One of the grim and eerie wonders of his book is the way in which just about every wrongheaded thing Washington did in that region in the fourteen-plus years since 9/11 had its surprising precursor in the two decades of American war there before the World Trade Center towers came down.”—The Huffington Post“The book reveals a number of critical truths  exposing deep flaws that have persisted for decades in American strategic thinking—flaws that have led successive American presidents to ask the American military to accomplish the impossible  often while barely providing it with the resources to accomplish even the most modest of goals. . . . Read Bacevich—not for the solutions he proposes but to be sobered by the challenge.”—National Review“In one arresting book after another  Andrew J. Bacevich has relentlessly laid bare the failings of American foreign policy since the Cold War. This one is his sad crowning achievement: the story of our long and growing military entanglement in the region of the most tragic  bitter  and intractable of conflicts.”—Richard K. Betts  director  Saltzman Institute of War and Peace Studies  Columbia University   “Andrew Bacevich offers the reader an unparalleled historical tour de force in a book that is certain to affect the formation of future U.S. foreign policy and any consequent decisions to employ military force. He presents sobering evidence that for nearly four decades the nation’s leaders have demonstrated ineptitude at nearly every turn as they shaped and attempted to implement Middle East policy. Every citizen aspiring to high office needs not only to read but to study and learn from this important book. This is one of the most serious and essential books I have read in more than half a century of public service.”—Lieutenant General Paul K. Van Riper  U.S. Marine Corps (Ret.)   “Bacevich asks and answers a provocative  inconvenient question: In a multigenerational war in the Middle East  ‘Why has the world’s mightiest military achieved so little?’ ”—Graham Allison  director  Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs  and Douglas Dillon Professor of Government at Harvard’s John F. Kennedy School of Government“Andrew Bacevich lays out in excruciating detail the disasters orchestrated over decades by the architects of the American empire in the Middle East. Blunder after blunder  fed by hubris along with cultural  historical  linguistic  and religious illiteracy  has shattered cohesion within the Middle East. The wars we have waged have given birth to a frightening nihilistic violence embodied in radical jihadism. They have engendered an inchoate rage among the dispossessed and left in their wake a series of failed and disintegrating states. These wars have  as Bacevich writes  laid bare the folly of attempting to use military force as a form of political  economic  and social control. Bacevich is one of our finest chroniclers of the decline of empire  and America’s War for the Greater Middle East is an essential addition to his remarkable body of work.”—Chris Hedges  former Middle East bureau chief for The New York Times and author of Wages of Rebellion: The Moral Imperative of Revolt   “Andrew Bacevich’s thoughtful  persuasive critique of America’s crusade for the Greater Middle East should be compulsory reading for anyone charged with making policy for the region. We cannot afford to repeat the past misjudgments on the area. As Bacevich wisely argues  the stakes are nothing less than the future well-being of the United States.”—Robert Dallek  author of Camelot’s Court: Inside the Kennedy White House  About the Author Andrew J. Bacevich is a retired professor of history and international relations at Boston University. A graduate of the U.S. Military Academy  he served for twenty-three years as a commissioned officer in the United States Army. He received his PhD in American diplomatic history from Princeton. Before joining the faculty of Boston University in 1998  he taught at West Point and at Johns Hopkins University.

"Life Reimagined: The Science  Art  and Opportunity of Midlife Review “Life Reimagined paints a portrait of middle age that is far from grim and decelerating.

"Language  Truth and Logic (Dover Books on Western Philosophy) From the Back Cover ""A delightful book … I should like to have written it myself.""—Bertrand RussellFirst published in 1936  this first full-length presentation in English of the Logical Positivism of Carnap  Neurath  and others has gone through many printings to become a classic of thought and communication. It not only surveys one of the most important areas of modern thought  it also shows the confusion that arises from imperfect understanding of the uses of language. A first-rate antidote for fuzzy thought and muddled writing  this remarkable book has helped philosophers  writers  speakers  teachers  students  and general readers alike.Mr. Ayers sets up specific tests by which you can easily evaluate statements of ideas. You will also learn how to distinguish ideas that cannot be verified by experience—those expressing religious  moral  or aesthetic experience  those expounding theological or metaphysical doctrine  and those dealing with a priori truth. The basic thesis of this work is that philosophy should not squander its energies upon the unknowable  but should perform its proper function in criticism and analysis."

The Collected Short Stories (City Plans) About the Author Satyajit Ray was born on 2 May 1921 in Calcutta. After graduating from Presidency College  Calcutta  in 1940  he studied art at Rabindranath Tagore’s university  Shantiniketan. By 1943  Ray was back in Calcutta and had joined an advertising firm as a visualizer. He also started designing covers and illustrating books brought out by Signet Press. A deep interest in films led to his establishing the Calcutta Film Society in 1947. During a six-month trip to Europe  in 1950  Ray became a member of the London Film Club and managed to see ninety-nine films in only four-and-a-half months.In 1955  after overcoming innumerable difficulties  Satyajit Ray completed his first film  Pather Panchali  with financial assistance from the West Bengal government. The film was an award-winner at the Cannes Film Festival and established Ray as a director of international stature. Together with Aparajito (The Unvanquished  1956) and Apur Sansar (The World of Apu  1959)  it forms the Apu trilogy and perhaps constitutes Ray’s finest work. Ray’s other films include Jalsaghar (The Music Room  1958)  Charulata (1964)  Aranyer Din Ratri (Days and Nights in the Forest  1970)  Shatranj Ke Khilari (The Chess Players  1977)  Ghare Baire (The Home and the World  1984)  Ganashatru (Enemy of the People  1989)  Shakha Proshakha (Branches of a Tree  1990)  and Agantuk (The Stranger  1991). Ray also made several documentaries  including one on Tagore. In 1987  he made the documentary Sukumar Ray  to commemorate the birth centenary of his father  perhaps Bengal’s most famous writer of nonsense verse and children’s books. Satyajit Ray won numerous awards for his films. Both the British Federation of Film Societies and the Moscow Film Festival Committee named him one of the greatest directors of the second half of the twentieth century. In 1992  he was awarded the Oscar for Lifetime Achievement by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Science and  in the same year  was also honoured with the Bharat Ratna. Apart from being a film-maker  Satyajit Ray was a writer of repute. In 1961  he revived the children’s magazine  Sandesh  which his grandfather  Upendrakishore Ray  had started and to which his father used to contribute frequently. Satyajit Ray contributed numerous poems  stories and essays to Sandesh  and also published several books in Bengali  most of which became best-sellers. In 1978  Oxford University awarded him its D.Litt degree. Satyajit Ray died in Calcutta in April 1992.

"The Perks of Being a Wallflower Review What is most notable about this funny  touching  memorable first novel from Stephen Chbosky is the resounding accuracy with which the author captures the voice of a boy teetering on the brink of adulthood. Charlie is a freshman. And while's he's not the biggest geek in the school  he is by no means popular. He's a wallflower--shy and introspective  and intelligent beyond his years  if not very savvy in the social arts. We learn about Charlie through the letters he writes to someone of undisclosed name  age  and gender  a stylistic technique that adds to the heart-wrenching earnestness saturating this teen's story. Charlie encounters the same struggles that many kids face in high school--how to make friends  the intensity of a crush  family tensions  a first relationship  exploring sexuality  experimenting with drugs--but he must also deal with his best friend's recent suicide. Charlie's letters take on the intimate feel of a journal as he shares his day-to-day thoughts and feelings: I walk around the school hallways and look at the people. I look at the teachers and wonder why they're here. If they like their jobs. Or us. And I wonder how smart they were when they were fifteen. Not in a mean way. In a curious way. It's like looking at all the students and wondering who's had their heart broken that day  and how they are able to cope with having three quizzes and a book report due on top of that. Or wondering who did the heart breaking. And wondering why. With the help of a teacher who recognizes his wisdom and intuition  and his two friends  seniors Samantha and Patrick  Charlie mostly manages to avoid the depression he feels creeping up like kudzu. When it all becomes too much  after a shocking realization about his beloved late Aunt Helen  Charlie retreats from reality for awhile. But he makes it back in due time  ready to face his sophomore year and all that it may bring. Charlie  sincerely searching for that feeling of ""being infinite "" is a kindred spirit to the generation that's been slapped with the label X. --Brangien Davis -- About the Author About the Author: Stephen Chbosky was born on January 25  1970.

Bistritz. -- Left Munich at 8.35 P.M. on 1st May  arriving at Vienna early next morning  should have arrived at 6.46  but train was an hour late. Buda-Pesth seems a wonderful place  from the glimpse which I got of it from the train and the little I could walk through the streets. I feared to go very far from the station  as we had arrived late and would start as near the correct time as possible. The impression I had was that we were leaving the West and entering the East  the most Western of splendid bridges over the Danube  which is here of noble width and depth  took us among the traditions of Turkish rule.We left in pretty good time  and came after nightfall to Klausenburgh. Here I stopped for the night at the Hôtel Royale. I had for dinner  or rather supper  a chicken done up some way with red pepper  which was very good but thirsty. (Mem.  get recipe for Mina.) I asked the waiter  and he said it was called 'paprika hendl ' and that  as it was a national dish  I should be able to get it anywhere along the Carpathians. I found my smattering of German very useful here  indeed  I don't know how I should be able to get on without it.Having some time at my disposal when in London  I had visited the British Museum  and made search among the books and maps of the library regarding Transylvania  it had struck me that some foreknowledge of the country could hardly fail to have some importance in dealing with a noble of that country. I find that the district he named is in the extreme east of the country  just on the borders of three states  Transylvania  Moldavia  and Bukovina  in the midst of the Carpathian mountains  one of the wildest and least known portions of Europe. I was not able to light on any map or work giving the exact locality of the Castle Dracula  as there are no maps of this country as yet to compare with our own Ordnance Survey maps  but I found that Bistritz  the post town named by Count Dracula  is a fairly well-known place. I shall enter here some of my notes  as they may refresh my memory when I talk over my travels with Mina.In the population of Transylvania there are four distinct nationalities: Saxons in the south  and mixed with them the Wallachs  who are the descendants of the Dacians  Magyars in the west  and Szekelys in the east and north. I am going among the latter  who claim to be descended from Attila and the Huns. This may be so  for when the Magyars conquered the country in the eleventh century they found the Huns settled in it. I read that every known superstition in the world is gathered into the horseshoe of the Carpathians  as if it were the centre of some sort of imaginative whirlpool  if so my stay may be very interesting. (Mem.  I must ask the Count all about them.)I did not sleep well  though my bed was comfortable enough  for I had all sorts of queer dreams. There was a dog howling all night long under my window  which may have had something to do with it  or it may have been the paprika  for I had to drink up all the water in my carafe  and was still thirsty. Towards morning I slept and was wakened by the continuous knocking at my door  so I guess I must have been sleeping soundly then. I had for breakfast more paprika  and a sort of porridge of maize flour which they said was 'mamaliga ' and egg-plant stuffed with forcemeat  a very excellent dish  which they call 'impletata.' (Mem.  get recipe for this also.) I had to hurry breakfast  for the train started a little before eight  or rather it ought to have done so  for after rushing to the station at 7.30 I had to sit in the carriage for more than an hour before we began to move. It seems to me that the further East you go the more unpunctual are the trains. What ought they to be in China?All day long we seemed to dawdle through a country which was full of beauty of every kind. Sometimes we saw little towns or castles on the top of steep hills such as we see in old missals  sometimes we ran by rivers and streams which seemed from the wide stony margin on each side of them to be subject to great floods. It takes a lot of water  and running strong  to sweep the outside edge of a river clear. At every station there were groups of people  sometimes crowds  and in all sorts of attire. Some of them were just like peasants at home or those I saw coming through France and Germany  with short jackets and round hats and home-made trousers  but others were very picturesque. The women looked pretty  except when you got near them  but they were all very clumsy about the waist. They had all full white sleeves of some kind or other  and most of them had big belts with a lot of strips of something fluttering from them like the dresses in a ballet  but of course petticoats under them. The strangest figures we saw were the Slovaks  who are more barbarian than the rest  with their big cowboy hats  great baggy dirty-white trousers  white linen shirts  and enormous heavy leather belts  nearly a foot wide  all studded over with brass nails. They wore high boots  with their trousers tucked into them  and had long black hair and heavy black moustaches. They are very picturesque  but do not look prepossessing. On the stage they would be set down at once as some old Oriental band of brigands. They are  however  I am told  very harmless and rather wanting in natural self-assertion.It was on the dark side of twilight when we got to Bistritz  which is a very interesting old place. Being practically on the frontier -- for the Borgo Pass leads from it into Bukovina -- it has had a very stormy existence  and it certainly shows marks of it. Fifty years ago a series of great fires took place  which made terrible havoc on five separate occasions. At the very beginning of the seventeenth century it underwent a siege of three weeks and lost 13 000 people  the casualties of war proper being assisted by famine and disease.Count Dracula had directed me to go to the Golden Krone Hotel  which I found  to my delight  to be thoroughly old-fashioned  for of course I wanted to see all I could of the ways of the country. I was evidently expected  for when I got near the door I faced a cheery-looking elderly woman in the usual peasant dress -- white undergarment with long double apron  front and back  of coloured stuff fitting almost too tight for modesty. When I came close she bowed  and said: 'The Herr Englishman?' 'Yes ' I said  'Jonathan Harker.' She smiled  and gave some message to an elderly man in white shirt-sleeves  who had followed her to the door. He went  but immediately returned with a letter: -- 'My Friend  -- Welcome to the Carpathians. I am anxiously expecting you. Sleep well to-night. At three to-morrow the diligence will start for Bukovina  a place on it is kept for you. At the Borgo Pass my carriage will await you and will bring you to me. I trust that your journey from London has been a happy one  and that you will enjoy your stay in my beautiful land. -- Your friend 'DRACULA.'4 May. -- I found that my landlord had got a letter from the Count  directing him to secure the best place on the coach for me  but on making inquiries as to details he seemed somewhat reticent  and pretended that he could not understand my German. This could not be true  because up to then he had understood it perfectly  at least  he answered my questions exactly as if he did. He and his wife  the old lady who had received me  looked at each other in a frightened sort of way. He mumbled out that the money had been sent in a letter  and that was all he knew. When I asked him if he knew Count Dracula  and could tell me anything of his castle  both he and his wife crossed themselves  and  saying that they knew nothing at all  simply refused to speak further. It was so near the time of starting that I had no time to ask anyone else  for it was all very mysterious and not by any means comforting.Just before I was leaving  the old lady came up to my room and said in a very hysterical way: -- 'Must you go? Oh! young Herr  must you go?' She was in such an excited state that she seemed to have lost her grip of what German she knew  and mixed it all up with some other language which I did not know at all. I was just able to follow her by asking many questions. When I told her that I must go at once  and that I was engaged on important business  she asked again: -- 'Do you know what day it is?' I answered that it was the fourth of May. She shook her head as she said again: -- 'Oh  yes! I know that  I know that! but do you know what day it is?' On my saying that I did not understand  she went on:'It is the eve of St George's Day. Do you not know that to-night  when the clock strikes midnight  all the evil things in the world will have full sway? Do you know where you are going  and what you are going to?' She was in such evident distress that I tried to comfort her  but without effect. Finally she went down on her knees and implored me not to go  at least to wait a day or two before starting. It was all very ridiculous  but I did not feel comfortable. However  there was business to be done  and I could allow nothing to interfere with it. I therefore tried to raise her up  and said  as gravely as I could  that I thanked her  but my duty was imperative  and that I must go. She then rose and dried her eyes  and taking a crucifix from her neck offered it to me. I did not know what to do  for  as an English Churchman  I have been taught to regard such things as in some measure idolatrous  and yet it seemed so ungracious to refuse an old lady meaning so well and in such a state of mind. She saw  I suppose  the doubt in my face  for she put the rosary round my neck  and said  'For your mother's sake ' and went out of the room. I am writing up this part of the diary whilst I am waiting for the coach  which is  of course  late  and the crucifix is still round my neck. Whether it is the old lady's fear  I do not know  but I am not feeling nearly as easy in my mind as usual. If this book should ever reach Mina before I do  let it bring my good-bye. Here comes the coach!5 May. -- The Castle. -- The grey of the morning has passed  and the sun is high over the distant horizon  which seems jagged  whether with trees or hills I know not  for it is so far off that big things and little are mixed. I am not sleepy  and  as I am not to be called till I awake  naturally I write till sleep comes. There are many odd things to put down  and  lest who reads them may fancy that I dined too well before I left Bistritz  let me put down my dinner exactly. I dined on what they call 'robber steak' -- bits of bacon  onion  and beef  seasoned with red pepper  and strung on sticks and roasted over the fire  in the simple style of the London cat's-meat! The wine was Golden Mediasch  which produces a queer sting on the tongue  which is  however  not disagreeable. I had only a couple of glasses of this  and nothing else.When I got on the coach the driver had not taken his seat  and I saw him talking with the landlady. They were evidently talking of me  for every now and then they looked at me  and some of the people who were sitting on the bench outside the door -- which they call by a name meaning 'word-bearer' -- came and listened  and then they looked at me  most of them pityingly. I could hear a lot of words often repeated  queer words  for there were many nationalities in the crowd  so I quietly got my polyglot dictionary from my bag and looked them out. I must say they were not cheering to me  for amongst them were 'Ordog' -- Satan  'pokol' -- hell  'stregoica' -- witch  'vrolok' and 'vlkoslak' -- both of which mean the same thing  one being Slovak and the other Servian for something that is either were-wolf or vampire. (Mem.  I must ask the Count about these superstitions.)When we started  the crowd round the inn door  which had by this time swelled to a considerable size  all made the sign of the cross and pointed two fingers towards me. With some difficulty I got a fellow-passenger to tell me what they meant  he would not answer at first  but on learning that I was English  he explained that it was a charm or guard against the evil eye. This was not very pleasant for me  just starting for an unknown place to meet an unknown man  but everyone seemed so kind-hearted  and so sorrowful  and so sympathetic that I could not but be touched. I shall never forget the last glimpse which I had of the inn-yard and its crowd of picturesque figures  all crossing themselves  as they stood round the wide archway  with its background of rich foliage of oleander and orange trees in green tubs clustered in the centre of the yard. Then our driver  whose wide linen drawers covered the whole front of the box-seat -- 'gotza' they call them -- cracked his big whip over his four small horses  which ran abreast  and we set off on our journey.I soon lost sight and recollection of ghostly fears in the beauty of the scene as we drove along  although had I known the language  or rather languages  which my fellow-passengers were speaking  I might not have been able to throw them off so easily. Before us lay a green sloping land full of forests and woods  with here and there steep hills  crowned with clumps of trees or with farmhouses  the blank gable end to the road. There was everywhere a bewildering mass of fruit blossom -- apple  plum  pear  cherry  and as we drove by I could see the green grass under the trees spangled with the fallen petals. In and out amongst these green hills of what they call here the 'Mittel Land' ran the road  losing itself as it swept round the grassy curve  or was shut out by the straggling ends of pine woods  which here and there ran down the hillsides like tongues of flame. The road was rugged  but still we seemed to fly over it with a feverish haste. I could not understand then what the haste meant  but the driver was evidently bent on losing no time in reaching Borgo Prund. I was told that this road is in summer-time excellent  but that it had not yet been put in order after the winter snows. In this respect it is different from the general run of roads in the Carpathians  for it is an old tradition that they are not to be kept in too good order. Of old the Hospadars would not repair them  lest the Turk should think that they were preparing to bring in foreign troops  and so hasten the war which was always really at loading point.Beyond the green swelling hills of the Mittel Land rose mighty slopes of forest up to the lofty steeps of the Carpathians themselves. Right and left of us they towered  with the afternoon sun falling upon them and bringing out all the glorious colours of this beautiful range  deep blue and purple in the shadows of the peaks  green and brown where grass and rock mingled  and an endless perspective of jagged rock and pointed crags  till these were themselves lost in the distance  where the snowy peaks rose grandly. Here and there seemed mighty rifts in the mountains  through which  as the sun began to sink  we saw now and again the white gleam of falling water. One of my companions touched my arm as we swept round the base of a hill and opened up the lofty  snow-covered peak of a mountain  which seemed  as we wound on our serpentine way  to be right before us: -- 'Look! Isten szek!' -- 'God's seat!' -- and he crossed himself reverently. As we wound on our endless way  and the sun sank lower and lower behind us  the shadows of the evening began to creep round us. This was emphasized by the fact that the snowy mountain-top still held the sunset  and seemed to glow out with a delicate cool pink. Here and there we passed Cszeks and Slovaks  all in picturesque attire  but I noticed that goitre was painfully prevalent. By the roadside were many crosses  and as we swept by  my companions all crossed themselves. Here and there was a peasant man or woman kneeling before a shrine  who did not even turn round as we approached  but seemed in the self-surrender of devotion to have neither eyes nor ears for the outer world. There were many things new to me: for instance  hay-ricks in the trees and here and there very beautiful masses of weeping birch  their white stems shining like silver through the delicate green of the leaves. Now and again we passed a leiter-waggon -- the ordinary peasant's cart  with its long  snake-like vertebra  calculated to suit the inequalities of the road. On this were sure to be seated quite a group of home-coming peasants  the Cszeks with their white  and the Slovaks with their coloured  sheepskins  the latter carrying lance-fashion their long staves  with axe at end. As the evening fell it began to get very cold  and the growing twilight seemed to merge into one dark mistiness the gloom of the trees  oak  beech  and pine  though in the valleys which ran deep between the spurs of the hills  as we ascended through the Pass  the dark firs stood out here and there against the background of late-lying snow. Sometimes  as the road was cut through the pine woods that seemed in the darkness to be closing down upon us  great masses of greyness  which here and there bestrewed the trees  produced a peculiarly weird and solemn effect  which carried on the thoughts and grim fancies engendered earlier in the evening  when the falling sunset threw into strange relief the ghost-like clouds which amongst the Carpathians seem to wind ceaselessly through the valleys. Sometimes the hills were so steep that  despite our driver's haste  the horses could only go slowly. I wished to get down and walk up them  as we do at home  but the driver would not hear of it. 'No  no ' he said  'you must not walk here  the dogs are too fierce ' and then he added  with what he evidently meant for grim pleasantry -- for he looked round to catch the approving smile of the rest -- 'and you may have enough of such matters before you go to sleep.' The only stop he would make was a moment's pause to light his lamps.When it grew dark there seemed to be some excitement amongst the passengers  and they kept speaking to him  one after the other  as though urging him to further speed. He lashed the horses unmercifully with his long whip  and with wild cries of encouragement urged them on to further exertions. Then through the darkness I could see a sort of patch of grey light ahead of us  as though there were a cleft in the hills. The excitement of the passengers grew greater  the crazy coach rocked on its great leather springs  and swayed like a boat tossed on a stormy sea. I had to hold on. The road grew more level  and we appeared to fly along. Then the mountains seemed to come nearer to us on each side and to frown down upon us  we were entering the Borgo Pass. One by one several of the passengers offered me gifts  which they pressed upon me with earnestness which would take no denial  these were certainly of an odd and varied kind  but each was given in simple good faith  with a kindly word  and a blessing  and that strange mixture of fear-meaning movements which I had seen outside the hotel at Bistritz -- the sign of the cross and the guard against the evil eye. Then  as we flew along  the driver leaned forward  and on each side the passengers  craning over the edge of the coach  peered eagerly into the darkness. It was evident that something very exciting was either happening or expected  but though I asked each passenger  no one would give me the slightest explanation. This state of excitement kept on for some little time  and at last we saw before us the Pass opening out on the eastern side. There were dark  rolling clouds overhead  and in the air the heavy  oppressive sense of thunder. It seemed as though the mountain range had separated two atmospheres  and that now we had got into the thunderous one. I was now myself looking out for the conveyance which was to take me to the Count. Each moment I expected to see the glare of lamps through the blackness  but all was dark. The only light was the flickering rays of our own lamps  in which steam from our hard-driven horses rose in a white cloud. We could now see the sandy road lying white before us  but there was on it no sign of a vehicle. The passengers drew back with a sigh of gladness  which seemed to mock my own disappointment. I was already thinking what I had best do  when the driver  looking at his watch  said to the others something which I could hardly hear  it was spoken so quietly and in so low a tone  I thought it was  'An hour less than the time.' Then  turning to me  he said in German worse than my own: -- 'There is no carriage here. The Herr is not expected  after all. He will now come on to Bukovina  and return to-morrow or the next day  better the next day.' Whilst he was speaking the horses began to neigh and snort and plunge wildly  so that the driver had to hold them up. Then  amongst a chorus of screams from the peasants and a universal crossing of themselves  a calèche  with four horses  drove up behind us  overtook us  and drew up beside the coach. I could see from the flash of our lamps  as the rays fell on them  that the horses were coal-black and splendid animals. They were driven by a tall man  with a long brown beard and a great black hat  which seemed to hide his face from us. I could only see the gleam of a pair of very bright eyes  which seemed red in the lamplight  as he turned to us. He said to the driver: -- 'You are early to-night  my friend.' The man stammered in reply: -- 'The English Herr was in a hurry ' to which the stranger replied: -- 'That is why  I suppose  you wished him to go on to Bukovina. You cannot deceive me  my friend  I know too much  and my horses are swift.' As he spoke he smiled  the lamplight fell on a hard-looking mouth  with very red lips and sharp-looking teeth  as white as ivory. One of my companions whispered to another the line from Burger's 'Lenore': -- 'Denn die Todten reiten schnell.' -- ('For the dead travel fast.')The strange driver evidently heard the words  for he looked up with a gleaming smile. The passenger turned his face away  at the same time putting out his two fingers and crossing himself. 'Give me the Herr's luggage ' said the driver  and with exceeding alacrity my bags were handed out and put in the calèche. Then I descended from the side of the coach  as the calèche was close alongside  the driver helping me with a hand which caught my arm in a grip of steel  his strength must have been prodigious. Without a word he shook his reins  the horses turned  and we swept into the darkness of the Pass. As I looked back I saw the steam from the horses of the coach by the light of the lamps  and projected against it the figures of my late companions crossing themselves. Then the driver cracked his whip and called to his horses  and off they swept on their way to Bukovina.As they sank into the darkness I felt a strange chill  and a lonely feeling came over me  but a cloak was thrown over my shoulders  and a rug across my knees  and the driver said in excellent German: -- 'The night is chill  mein Herr  and my master the Count bade me take all care of you. There is a flask of slivovitz [the plum brandy of the country] underneath the seat  if you should require it.' I did not take any  but it was a comfort to know it was there  all the same. I felt a little strange  and not a little frightened. I think had there been any alternative I should have taken it  instead of prosecuting that unknown night journey. The carriage went at a hard pace straight along  then we made a complete turn and went along another straight road. It seemed to me that we were simply going over and over the same ground again  and so I took note of some salient point  and found that this was so. I would have liked to have asked the driver what this all meant  but I really feared to do so  for I thought that  placed as I was  any protest would have had no effect in case there had been an intention to delay. By and by  however  as I was curious to know how time was passing  I struck a match  and by its flame looked at my watch  it was within a few minutes of midnight. This gave me a sort of shock  for I suppose the general superstition about midnight was increased by my recent experiences. I waited with a sick feeling of suspense.Then a dog began to howl somewhere in a farmhouse far down the road -- a long  agonized wailing  as if from fear. The sound was taken up by another dog  and then another and another  till  borne on the wind which now sighed softly through the Pass  a wild howling began  which seemed to come from all over the country  as far as the imagination could grasp it through the gloom of the night. At the first howl the horses began to strain and rear  but the driver spoke to them soothingly  and they quieted down  but shivered and sweated as though after a runaway from sudden fright. Then  far off in the distance  from the mountains on each side of us began a louder and sharper howling -- that of wolves -- which affected both the horses and myself in the same way -- for I was minded to jump from the calèche and run  whilst they reared again and plunged madly  so that the driver had to use all his great strength to keep them from bolting. In a few minutes  however  my own ears got accustomed to the sound  and the horses so far became quiet that the driver was able to descend and to stand before them. He petted and soothed them  and whispered something in their ears  as I have heard of horse-tamers doing  and with extraordinary effect  for under his caresses they became quite manageable again  though they still trembled. The driver again took his seat  and shaking his reins  started off at a great pace. This time  after going to the far side of the Pass  he suddenly turned down a narrow roadway which ran sharply to the right.Soon we were hemmed in with trees  which in places arched right over the roadway till we passed as through a tunnel  and again great frowning rocks guarded us boldly on either side. Though we were in shelter  we could hear the rising wind  for it moaned and whistled through the rocks  and the branches of the trees crashed together as we swept along. It grew colder and colder still  and fine powdery snow began to fall  so that soon we and all around us were covered with a white blanket. The keen wind still carried the howling of the dogs  though this grew fainter as we went on our way. The baying of the wolves sounded nearer and nearer  as though they were closing round on us from every side. I grew dreadfully afraid  and the horses shared my fear  but the driver was not in the least disturbed. He kept turning his head to left and right  but I could not see anything through the darkness.Suddenly  away on our left  I saw a faint flickering blue flame. The driver saw it at the same moment  he at once checked the horses and  jumping to the ground  disappeared into the darkness. I did not know what to do  the less as the howling of the wolves grew closer  but while I wondered the driver suddenly appeared again  and without a word took his seat  and we resumed our journey. I think I must have fallen asleep and kept dreaming of the incident  for it seemed to be repeated endlessly  and now  looking back  it is like a sort of awful nightmare. Once the flame appeared so near the road that even in the darkness around us I could watch the driver's motions. He went rapidly to where the blue flame rose -- it must have been very faint  for it did not seem to illumine the place around it at all -- and gathering a few stones  formed them into some device. Once there appeared a strange optical effect: when he stood between me and the flame he did not obstruct it  for I could see its ghostly flicker all the same. This startled me  but as the effect was only momentary  I took it that my eyes deceived me straining through the darkness. Then for a time there were no blue flames  and we sped onwards through the gloom  with the howling of the wolves around us  as though they were following in a moving circle.At last there came a time when the driver went further afield than he had yet done  and during his absence the horses began to tremble worse than ever and to snort and scream with fright. I could not see any cause for it  for the howling of the wolves had ceased altogether  but just then the moon  sailing through the black clouds  appeared behind the jagged crest of a beetling  pineclad rock  and by its light I saw around us a ring of wolves  with white teeth and lolling red tongues  with long  sinewy limbs and shaggy hair. They were a hundred times more terrible in the grim silence which held them than even when they howled. For myself  I felt a sort of paralysis of fear. It is only when a man feels himself face to face with such horrors that he can understand their true import.All at once the wolves began to howl as though the moonlight had had some peculiar effect on them. The horses jumped about and reared  and looked helplessly round with eyes that rolled in a way painful to see  but the living ring of terror encompassed them on every side  and they had perforce to remain within it. I called to the coachman to come  for it seemed to me that our only chance was to try to break out through the ring and to aid his approach. I shouted and beat the side of the calèche  hoping by the noise to scare the wolves from that side  so as to give him a chance of reaching the trap. How he came there  I know not  but I heard his voice raised in a tone of imperious command  and looking towards the sound  saw him stand in the roadway. As he swept his long arms  as though brushing aside some impalpable obstacle  the wolves fell back and back further still. Just then a heavy cloud passed across the face of the moon  so that we were again in darkness.When I could see again the driver was climbing into the calèche  and the wolves had disappeared. This was all so strange and uncanny that a dreadful fear came upon me  and I was afraid to speak or move. The time seemed interminable as we swept on our way  now in almost complete darkness  for the rolling clouds obscured the moon. We kept on ascending  with occasional periods of quick descent  but in the main always ascending. Suddenly I became conscious of the fact that the driver was in the act of pulling up the horses in the courtyard of a vast ruined castle  from whose tall black windows came no ray of light  and whose broken battlements showed a jagged line against the moonlit sky.Introduction  critical excerpts  and supplementary materials © 2003 by Simon &amp  Schuster  Inc."

It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life From AudioFile Lance Armstrong is a world-class cyclist and winner of the famed Tour de France the past two years. But he nearly died from cancer  and this book explores his grueling trip back up the figurative mountain  not only to life  but also to championship riding. He includes a section on his youth in Texas and how he started in bike racing. His illness taught him the patience he needed to become a winner. But the bulk of the book is about his battle with cancer. The book is conversational  which makes for an excellent adaptation to audio. The reader  Oliver Wyman  does a solid job. In fact  he reads with such emotion that listeners might swear they were hearing Armstrong himself--without the Texas accent  though.

How to Be a Bawse: A Guide to Conquering Life Review “Singh segues from her inspirational and uber-watched YouTube videos to essays on how to become a bawse  that is  a supremely self-confident person. She’s been named one of Time’s 2016 ‘30 Most Influential People on the Internet ’ Variety’s ‘10 Comics To Watch for 2016 ’ Forbes’s ‘30 Under 30 ’ Vogue’s ‘8 YouTube Stars That Are Taking Over the World ’ and more.”—Library Journal “Lilly is a bona fide #girlboss  boss  and bawse. Her meteoric rise has come with so many incredible lessons that we are all lucky to have access to. This book is a must-have for the hustler in all of us.”—Sophia Amoruso  founder and CEO  Girlboss  Excerpt. © Reprinted by permission. All rights reserved. Chapter 1Play NintendoI’m sweating in my blue overalls as I look at all the obstacles ahead of me. I have three options: (1) pound my head on this brick block and hope for a star  (2) run and jump over the enemy  or (3) step on this turtle’s head and force him to retract into his shell. No matter which option I go with  the fact remains that the Koopa Troopa up ahead is going to stay there. I can’t control it or convince it that it’s actually a Ninja Turtle and thus is in the wrong game. That’s fine. No Ninja Turtles means more pizza for me  and I’m Italian  so this is all working out. I know the Koopa Troopa isn’t going to listen to me  and therefore I need to control the only thing I can—and that’s me  Mario.Videogames are a great analogy for life. You go through levels  get thrown off by obstacles  and face several enemies. The game will become harder and harder  but it’s okay because you become smarter  faster  and more skilled. When playing a videogame  you control a character by making it jump  run  duck  and attack. I mean  that was back in my day when my Super Nintendo controller had two buttons. Today videogame controllers have as many buttons as a keyboard  so who knows what you can do. You can probably press A + Y + Z while twirling your left joystick and your character will sing the national anthem. Either way  the fact remains that your character is the only thing you can control in the game. The enemies will keep coming  the walls will keep shrinking  and the time will keep ticking away. It’s your job to navigate your character through a situation you cannot control.That’s exactly how you should view life. A Bawse understands that there are many things in life you have no control over and it is inefficient to become frustrated by that reality. Not being able to control people and situations doesn’t make you powerless  it just means you have to exercise your power in a different way. If you can’t control people  then control your reaction to them. If you can’t control a situation  then prepare for it.Before I started my career in the entertainment industry  I was the leader of a small dance company (if you could even call it that) in Toronto. We started off small  with only a few dancers  specializing in only Indian dance styles  but over time  in true Lilly fashion  I wanted to keep growing and expanding our horizons. Since I was little  I’ve had larger-than-life ideas. I never wanted to settle for something simple or mediocre  and as a result  when I did things  I wanted them to be the biggest and best things. There were so many other dance teams and companies around and I didn’t want to just be another addition to an already long list. I committed my days to transforming the company in the hopes of creating a dance empire that would take over the world. I really thought that was possible. We would be dancing Power Rangers who saved the world  one extended leg and pointed toe at a time. I decided to convert my basement into a full-blown office. We held auditions for dancers who were skilled in all forms of dance so that we could perform hip-hop  classical  and fusion in addition to what we were already doing. I organized photo shoots and video shoots and other creative marketing techniques. I had so much drive and determination that no injury  financial strain  or competition could steer me off my path. What I couldn’t see  however  was the one obstacle that was in front of me the entire time  and which caused everything to fall apart: the team itself.I had such big dreams for the company and I was always willing to work for them. Without hesitation  I would pull all-nighters to put together marketing materials  spend money out of my own pocket to invest in what we needed  and drive myself crazy thinking of innovative ways to set ourselves apart. But then I would arrive at practice and deal with three dancers showing up late  one not showing up at all  and two of them leaving early. Getting people to put in work on events to help our brand was like pulling teeth. We often performed at weddings and thus needed to adhere to a professional dress code  yet some dancers would occasionally show up wearing shorts and flip-flops. I would get so frustrated with them because I was putting in so much work for this dream  but the reality of the situation was that the dream was mine  not theirs. I tried for years to control them and make them work for something they didn’t care about as much as I did  and it just didn’t work.My dance company dreams faded away gradually  but the process was hastened by my discovery of YouTube. I remember feeling a new sensation the first time I uploaded a video. I wrote the script  shot it  edited it  and released it. No one else was involved or required  and the independence was exhilarating. Soon I developed an even greater drive and passion for my career as Superwoman than I’d had previously with my dance team. This time  however  I wasn’t trying to control a group of twenty people every time I needed something to get done. The only person I needed to control was the only person I could control  and that was me.Today  of course  I have a team that surrounds me and helps me to build my business. But Lilly is still at the root of Superwoman. The success of Superwoman and the failure of my dance team helped me learn a very important lesson: work with what’s in your control. This lesson can be applied to so many situations in our lives. You get frustrated when your parents nag you  so every time they do  you storm out of the room. You can’t control your parents  so stop trying. Instead  use that energy to control your reaction the next time they nag you. You might not be able to smash a brick block and find a star that makes you invincible  but you can practice patience and build up a resistance to nagging. If none of that works  you can find the closest green tube and transport yourself out of the conversation.Have you ever played a videogame then lost because you realized you were looking at the wrong part of the screen the whole time? You were so confused as to why your controller wasn’t working  but really you were just trying to control the wrong character. That’s what trying to control people is like in real life. We’re so often fixated on getting people to behave in accordance with what we want that we forget to focus on ourselves.The best way to stop people from pushing your buttons is to start pushing your own.A + Y + Z. Left joystick.“O Canada.”Chapter 2Conquer your thoughtsTouch your nose. No  I’m serious. I want you to stop reading after this sentence and don’t resume until you take your right hand and use it to touch the tip of your nose.Do it.Look at you! What an impressive piece of machinery you are. Do you know what you just did? You were introduced to a thought and decided to act on it  your brain sent signals through your neurotransmitters  through your body  and into your arm  prompting it to move and touch your magnificent nose.Why did I just make you touch your nose? Because I’m Simon and I run this town! No  but really  it was to show you that YOU control your mind  your mind doesn’t control you. You successfully directed your brain to touch your nose. Understanding your mind’s power is key to being a Bawse. Imagine using that same type of direction to instruct your mind to stop being negative  or jealous  or terrified. We often feel that we are slaves to biology. People say things like “I just can’t help but feel that way” or “I can’t control being jealous.” But I believe that  in most situations  we can teach our minds to function with more positivity and efficiency. In other words  by understanding that mushy sponge in our skulls  we can conquer our thoughts.What does conquering your thoughts mean? First  it means you get to wear an awesome warrior costume  so congrats on that victory! #OOTD Also  it means understanding why you feel the way you feel  what prompts you to carry out certain actions  what causes specific reactions  and what circumstances lead you to make regrettable decisions. Once you discover all the ins and outs of your mind  you basically have the cheat code to your game of life. All you have to do is input the data and you have access to extra mental weapons  stronger protection  and new passageways. Notice I said YOUR game of life and not THE game of life. That’s because everyone’s mind is different. The cheat codes you discover for your mind cannot be applied to all of humanity. I’m not encouraging you to study the BIOLOGY of the brain (it is fascinating  but also  who has that much time?). I’m encouraging you to study your specific psychological makeup.I was forced to learn how to conquer my thoughts because of the nature of my job. For six years I’ve been posting videos twice a week on the Internet. I have over 500 videos on my main channel and 500 videos on my second channel—that’s over 1 000 videos for people around the globe to view and judge as harshly as they desire. The Internet is wonderful and revolutionary  but let’s face it  it can also be extremely cruel. People feel they can say anything to you when they are sitting comfortably behind their computer screen being completely anonymous. When I first started posting videos  I got a lot of support (mostly because my friends and family would watch and they felt obligated to be nice. Also  I had a second account that I would use to compliment myself. Oops!)  but with time I started to receive negative  hateful comments and I didn’t know how to react. Here are a few examples (word for word  without spellcheck) of the comments I’ve received:This lily Singh paki ***** needs to die she’s everywhere I hate seeing her Bengali paki face I hope she gets cancer or her mum dies slowly j painfully leave focus tube alone up horrible black *****This is why women shouldn’t have rights.This video gave me cancershe is so ****ing stupid. she only get famous because she hot and thst sells but she is still dumb. I hope someone shoots herFUN!Do hateful comments still bother me? Sometimes  but not as often. How did I deal with them? When people ask me this  my response is usually  “I developed a thick skin.” But what I really mean is  I learned how to conquer my thoughts. This is how I broke it down:People are leaving mean comments.Why?Maybe it’s because my videos suck.Do you say mean things to people when you think they suck?No. Not unless I’m having a bad day or in a bad mood.Maybe people leaving the negative comments are having a bad day. Maybe that’s what the comment is really about.But the comments make me feel insecure.Do you like your videos?Yes.So should your opinion of your videos be dependent on what other people think? Is that the type of person you want to be?Not at all.So it doesn’t make sense to let the negative opinions of others impact what you think.Maybe I should stop making videos  though.Does making videos make you happy?Yes  very.Do you believe you should value negative comments above your own happiness?That doesn’t sound right. Maybe I should just reply to them?Or you could spend more time replying to people that make you feel good so they’re more encouraged to keep supporting you.Now  you may think a convo like this sounds a bit naive. OF COURSE people want to be happy and ignore negative comments  but it’s easier said than done. That’s why it’s important to closely analyze this conversation and discover all the cheat codes hidden within it.“Maybe they’re having a bad day.” CHEAT CODE ONE: Lilly  when people do or say hurtful things to you  there’s a chance they may actually be upset about something else in their life.“Should other opinions impact what you think about yourself?” CHEAT CODE TWO: Lilly  sometimes when you hear other opinions you’ll feel pressured to change your own. Before you enter into situations in which you will be confronted with a lot of opinions  make sure you strongly believe your own.“I don’t want to stop making videos  because they make me happy.” CHEAT CODE THREE: Your happiness is stronger than fear. You can continue battling fear as long as your videos  make you happy. Make sure you prioritize creating content that makes you happy  otherwise fear and negativity will slowly take over.“Maybe I should reply to them.” CHEAT CODE FOUR: Recognize that replying was suggested to make you feel better. Understand this impulse and catch it before you act on it. Make yourself feel better in a more constructive way.The cheat codes I discovered while dealing with YouTube comments have been useful in so many areas of my life. When someone cuts me off while driving  I apply cheat code one so that I don’t overreact: the person driving could be upset about something in their life. Cutting me off wasn’t about ME. When a brand offers me a lot of money to make a video I don’t actually like  I implement cheat code three: my content has to make me happy  otherwise negativity will start to seep in. When I’m having an argument and want to make an unnecessary remark to get the last word in  I try to catch myself because I know I’m just trying to make myself feel better—thus cheat code four. If I’ve gotten myself into an upsetting situation  it’s usually because I ignored a cheat code or pattern in my behavior.Conquering your thoughts is not a task that can be accomplished overnight  or over many nights  to be honest. It’s an ongoing process that requires frequent readjustment because your mind is constantly evolving. It requires you to ask yourself a lot of questions and to analyze the answers honestly. From now on start asking yourself WHY you feel a certain way  WHAT made you perform a certain action  and HOW you could do things differently. The information you discover is powerful because it helps you to discover patterns and in turn use your mind productively and efficiently. After all  your mind is your most powerful tool  but it’s not useful if you don’t know how to use it. It’s like trying to fix a printer with a stapler: it doesn’t work. Trust me  I’ve tried. The key is to use a hammer because all printers suck.

"AB de Villiers - The Autobiography From the Author The statistics tell barely half the story but  so far  AB de Villiers has scored more than 8 000 runs in Test cricket  more than 8 000 runs in one-day internationals and more than 24 000 runs in his professional career. Admired as a true entertainer wherever the game is played  he is distinguished not only by his brilliant strokeplay in all formats of the game  but also by his humble and determined captaincy of the South African national team in Tests and one-day internationals. 				    	 					 From the Inside Flap AB de Villiers is one of the finest batsmen ever to play cricket  and yet his achievement extends beyond his outrageous armoury of drives  pulls  paddles  scoops and flicks. Whether he is delighting home crowds at the Wanderers or Newlands  or setting new records in Bengaluru or Sydney  he plays the game in a wholehearted manner  projecting a positive image of his country around the world and also making millions of South Africans feel good about themselves. This is AB's story  in his own words. It's the story of the youngest of three talented  sports-mad brothers growing up in Warmbaths  of a boy who excelled at tennis  rugby and cricket  of a youngster who made his international debut at the age of twenty and was then selected in every single Test played by South Africa for the next eleven seasons  of a batsman who has started to redefine the art  being ranked among the world's very best in Test  ODI and T20. AB has remained a consistent and true sportsman through all the pyrotechnics - quick to deflect praise  swift to compliment opponents  eager to work hard  to embrace the team's next challenge and to relish what he still regards as the huge privilege of representing his country. AB de Villiers is a modern sporting phenomenon. 				    	 					              See all Product description"

Most industries have already been digitised--the media  music  banking--but perhaps the most important transformation will be in medicine  which still resembles something from the middle ages.

FIST OF GOD From Booklist Why was Saddam Hussein so confident in the face of U.S. and UN military might? Did he perhaps have a secret weapon to unleash on the armies defending Kuwait? Espionage-master Forsyth (The Day of the Jackal) raises such questions in his intriguing new novel  in which Saddam (who appears throughout at meetings of his Cabinet) does not seem to mind if thousands of his people are killed in battle. He's banking on the American and British traditional abhorrence of casualties. British brothers Mike and Terry Martin are experts in spying  and since Mike can easily pass for an Arab  he goes undercover  first into Kuwait  and then  in a particularly bold move  into Baghdad itself. Terry handles the organization of an elaborate mission to find Saddam's secret weapon  dubbed the fist of God. The information about the weapon comes to them from Jericho  a highly connected source in Saddam's inner circle. Meanwhile  a dowdy Viennese bank secretary is wined and dined by an Israeli spy posing as an Arabic student in order to get at her boss' vital information and cash. As usual  Forsyth's research is impeccable  his characters  though thinly drawn (Mike Martin is something of a superman)  are winning  his cameos of world leaders such as Bush  Thatcher  Schwarzkopf  Gorbachev  and Saddam himself help put the behind-the-scenes war in context  and Forsyth's ending  despite the obvious coalition victory  still offers a spectacular surprise.

"Digital Fortress Review Amazon.com Review In most thrillers  """"hardware"""" consists of big guns  airplanes  military vehicles  and weapons that make things explode. Dan Brown has written a thriller for those of us who like our hardware with disc drives and who rate our heroes by big brainpower rather than big firepower. It's an Internet user's spy novel where the good guys and bad guys struggle over secrets somewhat more intellectual than just where the secret formula is hidden--they have to gain understanding of what the secret formula actually is.  In this case  the secret formula is a new means of encryption  capable of changing the balance of international power. Part of the fun is that the book takes the reader along into an understanding of encryption technologies. You'll find yourself better understanding the political battles over such real-life technologies as the Clipper Chip and PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) software even though the book looks at the issues through the eyes of fiction.  Although there's enough globehopping in this book for James Bond  the real battleground is cyberspace  because that's where the """"bomb"""" (or rather  the new encryption algorithm) will explode. Yes  there are a few flaws in the plot if you look too closely  but the cleverness and the sheer fun of it all more than make up for them. There are enough twists and turns to keep you guessing and a lot of high  gee-whiz-level information about encryption  code breaking  and the role they play in international politics. Set aside the whole afternoon and evening for it and have finger food on hand for supper--you may want to read this one straight through.  About the Author Dan Brown is the author of numerous #1 bestselling novels  including Digital Fortress  Angels & Demons and The Da Vinci Code  which has sold more than 80 million copies worldwide  making it one of the best selling novels of all time. Named one of the World's 100 Most Influential People by TIME Magazine  he has appeared in the pages of Newsweek  Forbes  People  GQ  The New Yorker and others. His novels are published in 51 languages around the world. He is a graduate of Amherst College and Phillips Exeter Academy  where he also taught English.

Although most of us don’t need to lose too much sleep over bears these days  modern life does present plenty of other reasons for concern: terrorism  climate change  the rise of A.I.  encroachments on our privacy  even the apparent decline of international cooperation. In his fascinating new book  21 Lessons for the 21st Century  the historian Yuval Noah Harari creates a useful framework for confronting these fears. While his previous best sellers  Sapiens and Homo Deus  covered the past and future respectively  his new book is all about the present. The trick for putting an end to our anxieties  he suggests  is not to stop worrying. It’s to know which things to worry about  and how much to worry about them. . . . Harari is such a stimulating writer that even when I disagreed  I wanted to keep reading and thinking. . . . [Harari] has teed up a crucial global conversation about how to take on the problems of the twenty-first century.”—Bill Gates  The New York Times Book Review“If there were such a thing as a required instruction manual for politicians and thought leaders  Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari’s 21 Lessons for the 21st Century would deserve serious consideration. In this collection of provocative essays  Harari  author of the critically praised Sapiens and Homo Deus  tackles a daunting array of issues  endeavoring to answer a persistent question: ‘What is happening in the world today  and what is the deep meaning of these events?’ . . . Harari makes a passionate argument for reshaping our educational systems and replacing our current emphasis on quickly outdated substantive knowledge with the ‘four Cs’—critical thinking  communication  collaboration and creativity. . . . Thoughtful readers will find 21 Lessons for the 21st Century to be a mind-expanding experience.”—BookPage (top pick) “A sobering and tough-minded perspective on bewildering new vistas.”—Booklist (starred review)  “Magnificently combining historical  scientific  political  and philosophical perspectives  Harari . . . explores twenty-one of what he considers to be today’s ‘greatest challenges.’ Despite the title’s reference to ‘lessons ’ his tone is not prescriptive but exploratory  seeking to provoke debate without offering definitive solutions. . . . Within this broad construct  Harari discusses many pressing issues  including problems associated with liberal democracy  nationalism  immigration  and religion. This well-informed and searching book is one to be savored and widely discussed.”—Publishers Weekly (starred review) “A highly instructive exploration of ‘current affairs and . . . the immediate future of human societies.’ Having produced an international bestseller about human origins and avoided the sophomore jinx writing about our destiny  Harari proves that he has not lost his touch  casting a brilliantly insightful eye on today’s myriad crises  from Trump to terrorism  Brexit to big data. . . . [In] twenty-one painfully astute essays  he delivers his take on where our increasingly ‘post-truth’ world is headed. Human ingenuity  which enables us to control the outside world  may soon re-engineer our insides  extend life  and guide our thoughts. Science-fiction movies get the future wrong  if only because they have happy endings. Most readers will find Harari’s narrative deliciously reasonable  including his explanation of the stories (not actually true but rational) of those who elect dictators  populists  and nationalists. His remedies for wildly disruptive technology (biotech  infotech) and its consequences (climate change  mass unemployment) ring true  provided nations act with more good sense than they have shown throughout history. Harari delivers yet another tour de force.”—Kirkus Reviews (starred review)  About the Author Yuval Noah Harari has a Ph.D. in history from the University of Oxford  and now lectures at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem  specializing in world history. His two books  Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind and Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow  have become global best­sellers  with more than twelve million copies sold and translations in more than forty-five languages.

"Black Beauty (Signet Classics) About the Author Anna Sewell was born in Great Yarmouth  Norfolk  England  on March 30  1820. Brought up in a strict Quaker family  Anna developed a strong interest in horses as a young girl. But a crippling bone disease and a fall in 1834 left her an invalid for most of her life. By her mid-thirties she was severely lame and could only get around in a pony cart  and characteristically she would never use a whip on the animal. In 1871  she was told she had eighteen months to live  and by the end of that year  she had begun her book  Black Beauty  hoping it might make people a little kinder to their faithful horses. Although she was seriously ill  she lived long enough to finish her book and see it published in 1877. On April 25  1878  she died at her home in Old Catton near Norwich  England. Black Beauty  an enormous success from its first appearance  was soon adopted by the Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and used to improve the conditions of horses everywhere. 				    	 					 Excerpt. © Reprinted by permission. All rights reserved. My Early HomeThe first place that I can well remember was a large pleasant meadow with a pond of clear water in it. Some shady trees leaned over it  and rushes and water lilies grew at the deep end. Over the hedge on one side we looked into a plowed field  and on the other we looked over a gate at our master's house  which stood by the roadside. At the top of the meadow was a plantation of fir trees  and at the bottom a running brook overhung by a steep bank.While I was young I lived upon my mother's milk  as I could not eat grass. In the daytime I ran by her side  and at night I lay down close by her. When it was hot we used to stand by the pond in the shade of the trees  and when it was cold we had a nice warm shed near the plantation.As soon as I was old enough to eat grass  my mother used to go out to work in the daytime and come back in the evening.There were six young colts in the meadow besides me. They were older than I was  some were nearly as large as grown-up horses. I used to run with them  and had great fun  we used to gallop all together round and round the field  as hard as we could go. Sometimes we had rather rough play  for they would frequently bite and kick as well as gallop.One day  when there was a good deal of kicking  my mother whinnied to me to come to her  and then she said:""I wish you to pay attention to what I am going to say to you. The colts who live here are very good colts  but they are carthorse colts and  of course  they have not learned manners. You have been well bred and well born  your father has a great name in these parts  and your grandfather won the cup two years at the Newmarket races. Your grandmother had the sweetest temper of any horse I ever knew  and I think you have never seen me kick or bite. I hope you will grow up gentle and good  and never learn bad ways  do your work with a good will  lift your feet up well when you trot  and never bite or kick even in play.""I have never forgotten my mother's advice. I knew she was a wise old horse  and our master thought a great deal of her. Her name was Duchess  but he often called her Pet.Our master was a good  kind man. He gave us good food  good lodging  and kind words  he spoke as kindly to us as he did to his little children. We were all fond of him  and my mother loved him very much. When she saw him at the gate  she would neigh with joy  and trot up to him. He would pat and stroke her and say  ""Well  old Pet  and how is your little Darkie?"" I was a dull black  so he called me Darkie  then he would give me a piece of bread  which was very good  and sometimes he brought a carrot for my mother. All the horses would come to him  but I think we were his favorites. My mother always took him to the town on a market day in a light gig.There was a plowboy  Dick  who sometimes came into our field to pluck blackberries from the hedge. When he had eaten all he wanted  he would have what he called fun with the colts  throwing stones and sticks at them to make them gallop. We did not much mind him  for we could gallop off  but sometimes a stone would hit and hurt us.One day he was at this game and did not know that the master was in the next field  but he was there  watching what was going on. Over the hedge he jumped in a snap  and catching Dick by the arm  he gave him such a box on the ear as made him roar with the pain and surprise. As soon as we saw the master  we trotted up nearer to see what went on.""Bad boy!"" he said. ""Bad boy to chase the colts! This is not the first time  nor the second  but it shall be the last. There--take your money and go home. I shall not want you on my farm again."" So we never saw Dick anymore. Old Daniel  the man who looked after the horses  was just as gentle as our master  so we were well off. CHAPTER 2The HuntI was two years old when a circumstance happened which I have never forgotten. It was early in the spring  there had been a little frost in the night  and a light mist still hung over the plantations and meadows. I and the other colts were feeding at the lower part of the field when we heard  quite in the distance  what sounded like the cry of dogs. The oldest of the colts raised his head  pricked his ears  and said  ""There are the hounds!"" and immediately cantered off  followed by the rest of us to the upper part of the field  where we could look over the hedge and see several fields beyond. My mother and an old riding horse of our master's were also standing near  and seemed to know all about it.""They have found a hare "" said my mother  ""and if they come this way we shall see the hunt.""And soon the dogs were all tearing down the field of young wheat next to ours. I never heard such a noise as they made. They did not bark  nor howl  nor whine  but kept on a ""yo! yo  o  o! yo! yo  o  o!"" at the top of their voices. After them came a number of men on horseback  some of them in green coats  all galloping as fast as they could. The old horse snorted and looked eagerly after them  and we young colts wanted to be galloping with them  but they were soon away into the fields lower down. Here it seemed as if they had come to a stand  the dogs left off barking and ran about every way with their noses to the ground."

"How Bad Do You Want It?: Mastering the Psychology of Mind Over Muscle Review ""To be a great athlete  you need more than natural ability  you need mental strength to keep going when your body wants to quit. In his new book  writer Matt Fitzgerald dives into the research behind these coping skills and highlights the top athletes who use them. Anyone  whether pro or everyday exercisers  can use these tactics to push further."" - Men's Journal""Fitzgerald has been writing about the psychology of endurance performance for more than a decade now and is really one of the pioneers in terms of trying to take this body of research out of the laboratory and into the field for everyone to try. His latest book examines a series of notable races through the lens of Samuele Marcora's ""psychobiological"" theory of endurance. The races make it a fun read  and the psychology is thought-provoking."" - Runner's World magazine""At the highest level of sport  it's often not physiology but psychology that separates the best from the rest. Matt goes well beyond just telling stories of great athletes (though he's really good at doing that  too) and delves deep into cutting-edge brain science to show us all how we can strengthen our own mental muscle."" -- Huffington Post  Best Health and Fitness Books in 2015""The mind is the next frontier for significant performance gains...Mental fitness  says Fitzgerald  means becoming your own sports psychologist and developing coping mechanisms to help you suffer better. Which  while not entierly satisfying  is a good start."" -- Outside magazine""A book every that every endurance athlete should own...A page-turning read both for the narrative content and hard information...For all athletes drawn to pushing up against the red line to see what they've got."" -- LAVA magazine""Fitzgerald has done an exemplary job in making physiology and psychology understandable with contemporary research framing a creative and entertaining book that makes the subject come alive through charismatic writing."" - Canadian Running magazine""How Bad Do You Want It? really brings to life how important psychology is for endurance performance."" -- Samuele Marcora  PhD""Harnessing the power of the setback is a powerful motivation.

That's the premise of Matt Fitzgerald's How Bad Do You Want It?"" - Triathlon Magazine Canada""Fitzgerald's presentation digs into the very soul of his athletes to uncover innate traits and learned behaviors in ways that draw the reader right into the competition being described. This is a fantastic group of stories being told with literary skill far beyond most sports books... All the profiled athletes and all the masterful storytelling and all the research presented to back up the concepts he is illustrating become a cohesive effort by Fitzgerald to document the connections between the showcased sporting accomplishments and the mental fitness skills that propel those successes. Fitzgerald forms the foundation for constructing your own arsenal."" -- Oregon Distance Runner""How Bad Do You Want It perfectly introduces the exciting new understanding emerging in the world of sports psychology and exercise physiology.

But no matter how great  their physical abilities can take them only so far. The greatest moments in sports demand that these champions rely on their mind to confront and overpower the same fears we all face in sports and in life: fear of failure  fear of suffering  fear of change  to name a few. When we understand how much mental strength is demanded of the greatest athletes in pursuit of victory  their performances become vastly more inspiring. Behind every glorious win are doubts overcome  personal demons faced and setbacks surmounted.How Bad Do You Want It? describes a new psychobiological model of endurance performance connecting the mind and body through the brain  and explains how athletes are sometimes able to overcome physical limitations with mental might. Each story in the book is viewed through the lens of this model  shedding new light on what science has to say about mental fortitude in sports. With its compelling accounts from triathlon  cycling  running  rowing  and swimming How Bad Do You Want It? puts readers on the sidelines of more than a dozen epic races while also digging into the science to share the how and why of each transformative moment.

He has written for National Geographic  National Geographic Adventure  and Smithsonian. He lives in Cambridge  Massachusetts. 				    	 					 Excerpt. © Reprinted by permission. All rights reserved. Introduction In the wee hours of the morning of August 1  2008  some thirty climbers from ten different expeditions set out from their high camps on the Abruzzi Ridge of K2. At 28 251 feet the world's second- tallest mountain  K2  thrusts skyward out of the Karakoram Range of northern Pakistan. After weeks of sitting out bad weather  the mountaineers were poised to go for the summit on a clear and windless day. During the endless storms  morale at base camp had reached rock bottom  and some climbers had thrown in the towel and gone home. But now everybody still on the mountain was jazzed. As they emerged from their cramped tents to clip on crampons and hoist packs  the climbers were riding a manic high. Sometime that day  they thought  they would claim one of the most elusive and glorious prizes in mountaineering. For most of these men and women  K2 was the goal of a lifetime. Chapter 1: T H E M OT I VATORAlthough the various teams were operating independently  they had tried to cobble together a common logistical plan that would help everyone get to the top. The crucial feature of that plan was the fixing of thin nylon ropes— to be used on the way up  in effect  as handrails  and on the way down as lines that could be easily rappelled. Those fixed ropes were intended to ensure the climbers' passage through the Bottleneck  a steep and dangerous couloir of snow and ice that rises from an altitude of 26 400 feet. The Bottleneck and the sketchy leftward traverse at the top of it form the ""crux"" of the Abruzzi Ridge. Although climbing the Bottleneck is only moderately difficult  what makes that high gauntlet so nerve- racking is a gigantic serac— a cliff of solid ice— that looms above it. Weighing many tons  poised at a vertical and  in places  an overhanging angle  the serac looks as though it is barely attached to the mountain. Yet in the sixtynine years since mountaineers first came to grips with this formidable obstacle  the serac had proved remarkably stable. It seemed  indeed  to be a permanent feature of K2's summit pyramid. Thirty climbers crawling up the same route on the same day would have been business as usual on Mount Everest. On K2—a far more serious mountain  and one that has seen far fewer attempts— such a crowd was unprecedented. Still  as they approached the Bottleneck  thanks to the perfect weather for which they had waited so long  the climbers were awash in optimism. The summit was within their grasp. And then things started to go subtly wrong. Small mistakes were made. Miscommunications  fueled by the many different languages the climbers spoke  flared into angry words. The slower climbers began to block the way for those who were capable of moving faster. Yet the single event that turned an awkward day into a catastrophe was nobody's fault. Within the next thirty- six hours  eleven of those mountaineers would die high on the Abruzzi Ridge. The disaster that unfolded on August 1 would end up as the worst single- event tragedy in the mountain's history  and the second worst in the long chronicle of mountaineering in the Himalaya and the Karakoram. And nobody saw it coming. ------------- Almost sixteen years earlier  on August 16  1992  with my partners Scott Fischer and Charley Mace  I had left our high camp in the predawn darkness and started trudging up toward the Bottleneck. On that day  I  too  had been full of bursting hope  tempered by the wary alertness that is the obligatory state of mind for any alpinist who wants to stay alive in the great ranges. I had previously climbed Everest and Kangchenjunga  the first- and third- highest peaks in the world  but I knew that K2 was in another league of difficulty and danger. Like 2008's climbers  Scott  Charley  and I had had to bide our time for interminable weeks before we finally got a crack at the summit. Not only storms but all kinds of logistical snafus and interpersonal conflicts had delayed our final assault again and again. It was not until fifty- seven days after arriving at base camp that we finally set out for the top. On the other hand  on that August day in 1992  the three of us had had the Bottleneck to ourselves. And fixing ropes up the couloir was not part of our plan. In No Shortcuts to the Top  the memoir I wrote about climbing the world's fourteen highest peaks  I devoted a full chapter to my K2 expedition. Even after K2  it took me several years before I began to consider that it might be possible for me to reach the summit of all fourteen 8 000- meter peaks. For one thing  I didn't think there was any way that I could ever afford to go on so many expeditions. For another  climbing all fourteen 8 000ers seemed far too ambitious a goal. The first person to accomplish that feat had been the great Tyrolean mountaineer Reinhold Messner  who knocked off his fourteenth in 1986. And Messner was like a god to me. Yet with K2  I became the first American to climb the world's three highest mountains. The outdoor magazines ran a few short profiles about me. One of them was titled ""Ed Who?"" Even after those pieces appeared  I was still relatively unknown to the general public  but with the boost in confidence they gave me  I finally got up the nerve to start approaching potential sponsors. K2 was a huge turning point in my life. Yes  it brought me my first modest taste of what you might call ""mountaineering celebrity."" But far more important than any faint whiff of fame were the lessons K2 taught me.  In the aftermath of 2008's disaster  all kinds of armchair ""experts"" delivered their scathing critiques. Nonclimbers clogging the online chat rooms  in response to sensational newspaper articles  took a macabre delight in the tragedy. This was Everest 1996 all over again  they seemed to think— the melodrama of clueless dilettantes who had no business on the mountain buying their way into a catastrophe at the cost of their own lives  as well as the lives of professional guides entrusted with caring for them. (Hundreds of readers of Jon Krakauer's bestseller Into Thin Air reduced his complicated narrative to that simplistic morality play.) After the August 2008 tragedy  Messner himself sounded off in this vein  decrying the ""K2 package deals"" that he assumed had lured novices to the mountain and concluding  ""Something like this is just pure stupidity."" Messner was not the only famous mountaineer to criticize the victims of the 2008 disaster. The temptation to second- guess those luckless climbers' decisions was all but irresistible. Newspapers  magazines  and radio and TV shows called me for my commentary. I was already beginning to think that what had happened on K2 on August 1 was far more complicated than the first tabloid and Internet versions of the story. It would take several weeks for more detailed accounts to trickle down from the slopes of the mountain and find their way to responsible media outlets. And I was not about to cast facile aspersions on climbers who had died on the mountain  or had barely survived it. In 1992  K2 had not only proved to be a turning point in my life— it had been the scene of what I still regard as the greatest mistake I ever made as a mountaineer. The most important lesson I learned from that beautiful and dangerous peak was a blunt one: Don't ever do that again if you want to stay alive. Listen to your instincts  and follow them. Recently  I reread my diary from the K2 trip. I was struck by how different it seemed from the account I had written in No Shortcuts. Events and relationships that seemed really important when they were happening barely made it into the chapter I wrote thirteen years after the expedition. Conversely  some of the most dramatic turning points of my weeks on K2 got covered in my diary in only a few deadpan sentences. I wasn't writing the diary  of course  for anybody else to read. At the time  I thought I was simply making a day- by- day record of the most ambitious mountaineering attempt of my life up to that point. Now I wonder. Any ""story"" can be told in dozens of different ways. For that very reason  I believe  every time you go back and reexamine an important chapter in your life  you learn something new about it. And the reactions of audiences when I give slide shows  as well as the e- mails I received from folks who read No Shortcuts to the Top  gave me many new insights into my own experience. I have always believed that climbing mountains teaches you lessons. And more than that  I firmly believe that those lessons can be applied to the rest of your life. It's not an easy process  however. Mountaineering literature is full of trite clichés about ""conquering an enemy"" or ""transcending your limits."" For at least two centuries  philosophers of the outdoors have insisted that nature is ""a school of character."" Would that it were all so simple! The most important lesson I learned from K2 was that by simply putting off making a decision  I made the worst decision of my life: to climb on into a gathering storm. I was lucky to survive our summit push on K2. Scott and Charley didn't agree with me about this. That day  they never seemed to suffer from the nagging doubts— the knot in my gut  as I've always thought of it— I carried with me hour after hour. Yet my partners' comparatively blithe attitude about our climbing on that August 16 doesn't even begin to tempt me to revise my judgment. It's ultimately a personal thing. K2 is often called the hardest mountain in the world. It's also often called the deadliest. This may not be strictly true: in terms of the ratio of climbers who get to the top compared to those who die on the mountain  Annapurna is more deadly than K2. (I succeeded on Annapurna  in fact  only on my third try  in 2005  and only after I'd begun to wonder whether it was too dangerous a peak to justify another attempt. It became my n..."

Hearing Aid Battery Size 675  Power One  60 Pcs Hearing aid batteries are an important consideration for anyone looking to purchase a new pair of hearing aids. If you are new to the world of hearing aids  you’re probably asking yourself the following questions: How long can you expect hearing aid batteries to last? How much will hearing aid batteries cost? Are some hearing aids better than others when it comes to battery life? Does wireless audio streaming impact battery life? Background: Hearing Aid Battery Current Drain. Hearing aid manufacturers have long provided information about their products’ battery usage in the “datasheets” that cover the technical specifications of each hearing aid. As an example  Resounds datasheet for the Resound LiNX2 LS61 shows that the hearing aid (which uses a size 312 battery) drains 1.3 mili-Amps (mA) from the battery when tested in “test mode” via the ANSI S3.22 standard. In theory  it should be easy to estimate the expected battery life of the hearing aid. Given that a size 312 battery has a capacity of 145 mili-Amp-hours (mAh)  one merely divides 145 mAh by 1.3 mA to arrive at an estimated battery life of 111.5 hours. Zinc–air batteries  and zinc–air fuel cells are metal-air batteries powered by oxidizing zinc with oxygen from the air. These batteries have high energy densities and are relatively inexpensive to produce.

"The Communist Manifesto (Napier & Judd Series) (Bantam Classics) From the Inside Flap ""A spectre is haunting Europe - the spectre of Communism."" So begins one of history's most important documents  a work of such magnitude that it has forever changed not only the scope of world politics  but indeed the course of human civilization. The Communist Manifesto was written in Friedrich Engels's clear  striking prose and declared the earth-shaking ideas of Karl Marx. Upon publication in 1848  it quickly became the credo of the poor and oppressed who longed for a society ""in which the free development of each is the condition for the free development of all."" The Communist Manifesto contains the seeds of Marx's more comprehensive philosophy  which continues to inspire influential economic  political  social  and literary theories. But the Manifesto is most valuable as an historical document  one that led to the greatest political upheaveals of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries and to the establishment of the Communist governments that until recently ruled half the globe. This Bantam Classic edition of The Communist Manifesto includes Marx and Engels's historic 1872 and 1882 prefaces  and Engels's notes and prefaces to the 1883 and 1888 editions. 				    	 					 About the Author KARL MARX (1818-1883) is today considered one of the world's seminal thinkers  although at his death he was  in his own words  ""the best hated and most calumniated man of his time."" Born in Trier  Prussia  he was descended from a rabbinical family. At the University of Bonn and later at the University of Berlin  he joined a group of radicals who espoused the ideas of Hegel. After emigrating to Paris in 1843 he became deeply committed to communism and the overthrow of tyranny. Here too he began his lifelong association with Friedrich Engels. Finally settling in London with his wife and family  Marx lived the rest of his life in abject poverty while creating his masterwork  Das Kapital  and becoming the leading spirit of revolution throughout the world. FRIEDRICH ENGELS (1820-1895) is known primarily as the intellectual companion of Karl Marx. The son of a German textile manufacturer  Engels became the collaborator and staunch supporter of Marx before and during the European revolutions of 1848  when together they created The Communist Manifesto. When Engels outlived his friend by twelve years  he dedicated himself to editing Marx's manuscripts and completing the two volumes of Das Kapital left unfinished. A true friend to the end  he willed all his property to Marx's children. 				    	 					              See all Product description"

The timeless message of the book is that we are each responsible for our own reality and ""dis-ease."" Hay believes we make ourselves ill by having thoughts of self-hatred. She includes a directory of ailments and emotional causes for each with a corresponding affirmation to help overcome the illness. For example  the probable cause of multiple sclerosis is ""mental hardness  hard-heartedness  iron will  and inflexibility."" The healing ""thought pattern"" would be: ""By choosing loving  joyous thoughts  I created a loving joyous world. I am safe and free."" --P. Randall Cohan 				    	 					 Review This is one of the best books I have ever read on Personal healing.

Complications: A Surgeon's Notes on an Imperfect Science Review “None surpass Gawande in the ability to create a sense of immediacy  in his power to conjure the reality of the ward  the thrill of the moment-by-moment medical or surgical drama. Complications impresses for its truth and authenticity  virtues that it owes to its author being as much forceful writer as uncompromising chronicler.” ―The New York Times Book Review“No one writes about medicine as a human subject as well as Atul Gawande. His stories about becoming a surgeon are scary  funny  absorbing....Complications is a uniquely soulful book about the science of mending bodies.” ―Adam Gopnik  author of Paris to the Moon“Gawande is arguably the best nonfiction doctor-writer around....He's prescient and thoughtful...the heir to Lewis Thomas' humble  insightful and brilliantly crafted oeuvre.” ―Salon.com“Complications is a book about medicine that reads like a thriller. Every subject Atul Gawande touches is probed and dissected and turned inside out with such deftness and feeling and counterintuitive insight that the reader is left breathless.” ―Malcolm Gladwell  author of The Tipping Point“Gawande is a writer with a scalpel pen and an X-ray eye.... He turns every case--from gunshot wounds to morbid obesity to flesh-eating bacteria--into a thriller in miniature. Diagnosis: riveting.” ―Time“Gawande's prose  much like the scalpel he wields  is precise  daring  but never reckless....Much like reading George Orwell  the reader emerges entertained  enlightened  transformed and immensely satisfied.” ―Abraham Verghese  author of My Own Country“Wrenching human tales...Gawande has pushed the medical yarn in a new direction.” ―The Boston Globe“Atul Gawande is a rare and wonderful storyteller who portrays his profession with bravery and humanity.” ―Ellen Goodman  Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist“The stories in Complications are gripping medical mysteries that always have something extra. Gawande draws you in with the story but leaves you wiser about science  about health care issues  and even about the human condition.” ―Michael Kinsley About the Author Atul Gawande is a surgical resident at a hospital in Boston and a staff writer on medicine and science for The New Yorker. A graduate of Harvard Medical School and the Harvard School of Public Health  he has had his writing selected to appear in The Best American Essays 2002.

At last I realized that they did not see.... -SHAMS OF TABRIZPrologue    Between your fingers you hold a stone and throw it into flowing water. The effect might not be easy to see. There will be a small ripple where the stone breaks the surface and then a splash  muffled by the rush of the surrounding river. That’s all.Throw a stone into a lake. The effect will be not only visible but also far more lasting. The stone will disrupt the still waters. A circle will form where the stone hit the water  and in a flash that circle will multiply into another  then another. Before long the ripples caused by one plop will expand until they can be felt everywhere along the mirrored surface of the water. Only when the circles reach the shore will they stop and die out.If a stone hits a river  the river will treat it as yet another commotion in its already tumultuous course. Nothing unusual. Nothing unmanageable.If a stone hits a lake  however  the lake will never be the same again.For forty years Ella Rubinstein’s life had consisted of still waters—a predictable sequence of habits  needs  and preferences. Though it was monotonous and ordinary in many ways  she had not found it tiresome. During the last twenty years  every wish she had  every person she befriended  and every decision she made was filtered through her marriage. Her husband  David  was a successful dentist who worked hard and made a lot of money. She had always known that they did not connect on any deep level  but connecting emotionally need not be a priority on a married couple’s list  she thought  especially for a man and a woman who had been married for so long. There were more important things than passion and love in a marriage  such as understanding  affection  compassion  and that most godlike act a person could perform  forgiveness. Love was secondary to any of these. Unless  that is  one lived in novels or romantic movies  where the protagonists were always larger than life and their love nothing short of legend.Ella’s children topped her list of priorities. They had a beautiful daughter in college  Jeannette  and teenage twins  Orly and Avi. Also  they had a twelve-year-old golden retriever  Spirit  who had been Ella’s walking buddy in the mornings and her cheeriest companion ever since he’d been a puppy. Now he was old  overweight  completely deaf  and almost blind  Spirit’s time was coming  but Ella preferred to think he would go on forever. Then again  that was how she was. She never confronted the death of anything  be it a habit  a phase  or a marriage  even when the end stood right in front of her  plain and inevitable.The Rubinsteins lived in Northampton  Massachusetts  in a large Victorian house that needed some renovation but still was splendid  with five bedrooms  three baths  shiny hardwood floors  a three-car garage  French doors  and  best of all  an outdoor Jacuzzi. They had life insurance  car insurance  retirement plans  college savings plans  joint bank accounts  and  in addition to the house they lived in  two prestigious apartments: one in Boston  the other in Rhode Island. She and David had worked hard for all this. A big  busy house with children  elegant furniture  and the wafting scent of homemade pies might seem a cliché to some people  but to them it was the picture of an ideal life. They had built their marriage around this shared vision and had attained most  if not all  of their dreams.On their last Valentine’s Day  her husband had given her a heart-shaped diamond pendant and a card that read To my dear Ella  A woman with a quiet manner  a generous heart  and the patience of a saint. Thank you for accepting me as I am. Thank you for being my wife. Yours DavidElla had never confessed this to David  but reading his card had felt like reading an obituary. This is what they will write about me when I die  she had thought. And if they were sincere  they might also add this:Building her whole life around her husband and children  Ella lacked any survival techniques to help her cope with life’s hardships on her own. She was not the type to throw caution to the wind. Even changing her daily coffee brand was a major effort.All of which is why no one  including Ella  could explain what was going on when she filed for divorce in the fall of 2008 after twenty years of marriage.But there was a reason: love.They did not live in the same city. Not even on the same continent. The two of them were not only miles apart but also as different as day and night. Their lifestyles were so dissimilar that it seemed impossible for them to bear each other’s presence  never mind fall in love. But it happened. And it happened fast  so fast in fact that Ella had no time to realize what was happening and to be on guard  if one could ever be on guard against love.Love came to Ella as suddenly and brusquely as if a stone had been hurled from out of nowhere into the tranquil pond of her life.Ella    NORTHAMPTON  MAY 17  2008 Birds were singing outside her kitchen window on that balmy day in spring. Afterward Ella replayed the scene in her mind so many times that  rather than a fragment from the past  it felt like an ongoing moment still happening somewhere out there in the universe.There they were  sitting around the table  having a late family lunch on a Saturday afternoon. Her husband was filling his plate with fried chicken legs  his favorite food. Avi was playing his knife and fork like drumsticks while his twin  Orly  was trying to calculate how many bites of which food she could eat so as not to ruin her diet of 650 calories a day. Jeannette  who was a freshman at Mount Holyoke College nearby  seemed lost in her thoughts as she spread cream cheese on another slice of bread. Also at the table sat Aunt Esther  who had stopped by to drop off one of her famous marble cakes and then stayed on for lunch. Ella had a lot of work to do afterward  but she was not ready to leave the table just yet. Lately they didn’t have too many shared family meals  and she saw this as a golden chance for everyone to reconnect.“Esther  did Ella give you the good news?” David asked suddenly. “She found a great job.”Though Ella had graduated with a degree in English literature and loved fiction  she hadn’t done much in the field after college  other than editing small pieces for women’s magazines  attending a few book clubs  and occasionally writing book reviews for some local papers. That was all. There was a time when she’d aspired to become a prominent book critic  but then she simply accepted the fact that life had carried her elsewhere  turning her into an industrious housewife with three kids and endless domestic responsibilities.Not that she complained. Being the mother  the wife  the dog walker  and the housekeeper kept her busy enough. She didn’t have to be a breadwinner on top of all these. Though none of her feminist friends from Smith College approved of her choice  she was satisfied to be a stay-at-home mom and grateful that she and her husband could afford it. Besides  she had never abandoned her passion for books and still considered herself a voracious reader.A few years ago  things had begun to change. The children were growing up  and they made it clear that they didn’t need her as much as they once had. Realizing that she had too much time to spare and no one to spend it with  Ella had considered how it might be to find a job. David had encouraged her  but though they kept talking and talking about it  she rarely pursued the opportunities that came her way  and when she did  potential employers were always looking for someone younger or more experienced. Afraid of being rejected over and over  she had simply let the subject drop.Nevertheless  in May 2008 whatever obstacle had impeded her from finding a job all these years unexpectedly vanished. Two weeks shy of her fortieth birthday  she found herself working for a literary agency based in Boston. It was her husband who found her the job through one of his clients—or perhaps through one of his mistresses.“Oh  it’s no big deal ” Ella rushed to explain now. “I’m only a part-time reader for a literary agent.”But David seemed determined not to let her think too little of her new job. “Come on  tell them it’s a well-known agency ” he urged  nudging her  and when she refused to comply  he heartily agreed with himself. “It’s a prestigious place  Esther. You should see the other assistants! Girls and boys fresh out of the best colleges. Ella is the only one going back to work after being a housewife for years. Now  isn’t she something?”Ella wondered if  deep inside  her husband felt guilty about keeping her away from a career  or else about cheating on her—these being the only two explanations she could think of as to why he was now going overboard in his enthusiasm.Still smiling  David concluded  “This is what I call chutzpah. We’re all proud of her.”“She is a prize. Always was ” said Aunt Esther in a voice so sentimental that it sounded as if Ella had left the table and was gone for good.They all gazed at her lovingly. Even Avi didn’t make a cynical remark  and Orly for once seemed to care about something other than her looks. Ella forced herself to appreciate this moment of kindness  but she felt an overwhelming exhaustion that she had never experienced before. She secretly prayed for someone to change the subject.Jeannette  her older daughter  must have heard the prayer  for she suddenly chimed in  “I have some good news  too.”All heads turned toward her  faces beaming with expectation.“Scott and I have decided to get married ” Jeannette announced. “Oh  I know what you guys are going to say! That we haven’t finished college yet and all that  but you’ve got to understand  we both feel ready for the next big move.”An awkward silence descended upon the kitchen table as the warmth that had canopied them just a moment ago evaporated. Orly and Avi exchanged blank looks  and Aunt Esther froze with her hand tightened around a glass of apple juice. David put his fork aside as if he had no appetite left and squinted at Jeannette with his light brown eyes that were deeply creased with smile lines at the corners. However  right now he was anything but smiling. His mouth had drawn into a pout  as though he had just downed a swig of vinegar.“Great! I expected you to share my happiness  but I get this cold treatment instead ” Jeannette whined.“You just said you were getting married ” remarked David as ifJeannette didn’t know what she’d said and needed to be informed.“Dad  I know it seems a bit too soon  but Scott proposed to me the other day and I’ve already said yes.”“But why?” asked Ella.From the way Jeannette looked at her  Ella reckoned  that was not the kind of question her daughter had expected. She would rather have been asked “When?” or “How?” In either case it meant that she could start shopping for her wedding dress. The question “Why?” was another matter altogether and had completely caught her off guard.“Because I love him  I guess.” Jeannette’s tone was slightly condescending.“Honey  what I meant was  why the rush?” insisted Ella. “Are you pregnant or something?”Aunt Esther twitched in her chair  her face stern  her anguish visible. She took an antacid tablet from her pocket and started chewing on it.“I’m going to be an uncle ” Avi said  giggling.Ella held Jeannette’s hand and gave it a gentle squeeze. “You can always tell us the truth. You know that  right? We’ll stand by you no matter what.”“Mom  will you please stop that?” Jeannette snapped as she pulled her hand away. “This has nothing to do with pregnancy. You’re embarrassing me.”“I was just trying to help ” Ella responded calmly  calmness being a state she had been lately finding harder and harder to achieve.“By insulting me  you mean. Apparently the only way you can see Scott and me getting married is me being knocked up! Does it ever occur to you that I might  just might  want to marry this guy because I love him? We have been dating for eight months now.”This elicited a scoff from Ella. “Oh  yeah  as if you could tell a man’s character in eight months! Your father and I have been married for almost twenty years  and even we can’t claim to know everything about each other. Eight months is nothing in a relationship!”“It took God only six days to create the entire universe ” said Avi  beaming  but cold stares from everyone at the table forced him back into silence.Sensing the escalating tension  David  his eyes fixed on his elder daughter  his brow furrowed in thought  interjected  “Honey  what your mom is trying to say is that dating is one thing  marrying is quite another.”“But  Dad  did you think we would date forever?” Jeannette asked.Drawing in a deep breath  Ella said  “To be perfectly blunt  we were expecting you to find someone better. You’re too young to get involved in any serious relationship.”“You know what I’m thinking  Mom?” Jeannette said in a voice so flat as to be unrecognizable. “I’m thinking you’re projecting your own fears onto me. But just because you married so young and had a baby when you were my age  that doesn’t mean I’m going to make the same mistake.”Ella blushed crimson as if slapped in the face. From deep within she remembered the difficult pregnancy that had resulted in Jeannette’s premature birth. As a baby and then as a toddler  her daughter had drained all of her energy  which was why she had waited six years before getting pregnant again.“Sweetheart  we were happy for you when you started dating Scott ” David said cautiously  trying a different strategy. “He’s a nice guy. But who knows what you’ll be thinking after graduation? Things might be very different then.”Jeannette gave a small nod that conveyed little more than feigned acquiescence. Then she said  “Is this because Scott isn’t Jewish?”David rolled his eyes in disbelief. He had always taken pride in being an open-minded and cultured father  avoiding negative remarks about race  religion  or gender in the house.Jeannette  however  seemed relentless. Turning to her mother  she asked  “Can you look me in the eye and tell me you’d still be making the same objections if Scott were a young Jewish man named Aaron?”Jeannette’s voice needled with bitterness and sarcasm  and Ella feared there was more of that welling up inside her daughter.“Sweetheart  I’ll be completely honest with you  even if you might not like it. I know how wonderful it is to be young and in love. Believe me  I do. But to get married to someone from a different background is a big gamble. And as your parents we want to make sure you’re doing the right thing.”“And how do you know your right thing is the right thing for me?”The question threw Ella off a little. She sighed and massaged her forehead  as if on the verge of a migraine.“I love him  Mom. Does that mean anything to you? Do you remember that word from somewhere? He makes my heart beat faster. I can’t live without him.”Ella heard herself chuckle. It was not her intention to make fun of her daughter’s feelings  not at all  but that was probably what her laughing to herself sounded like. For reasons unknown to her  she felt extremely nervous. She’d had fights with Jeannette before  hundreds of them  but today it felt as though she were quarreling with something else  something bigger.“Mom  haven’t you ever been in love?” Jeannette retorted  a hint of contempt creeping into her tone.“Oh  give me a break! Stop daydreaming and get real  will you? You’re being so ... ” Ella’s eyes darted toward the window  hunting for a dramatic word  until finally she came up with “ . . . romantic!”“What’s wrong with being romantic?” Jeannette asked  sounding offended.Really  what was wrong with being romantic? Ella wondered. Since when was she so annoyed by romanticism? Unable to answer the questions tugging at the edges of her mind  she continued all the same. “Come on  honey. Which century are you living in? Just get it in your head  women don’t marry the men they fall in love with. When push comes to shove  they choose the guy who’ll be a good father and a reliable husband. Love is only a sweet feeling bound to come and quickly go away.”When she finished talking  Ella turned to her husband. David had clasped his hands in front of him  slowly as if through water  and was looking at her like he’d never seen her before.“I know why you’re doing this ” Jeannette said. “You’re jealous of my happiness and my youth. You want to make an unhappy housewife out of me. You want me to be you  Mom.”Ella felt a strange  sinking feeling in the pit of her stomach  as if she had a giant rock sitting there. Was she an unhappy housewife? A middle-aged mom trapped in a failing marriage? Was this how her children saw her? And her husband  too? What about friends and neighbors? Suddenly she had the feeling that everyone around her secretly pitied her  and the suspicion was so painful that she gasped.“You should apologize to your mom ” David said  turning to Jeannette with a frown on his face.“It’s all right. I don’t expect an apology ” Ella said dejectedly.Jeannette gave her mother a mock leer. And just like that  she pushed back her chair  threw her napkin aside  and walked out of the kitchen. After a minute Orly and Avi silently followed suit  either in an unusual act of solidarity with their elder sister or because they’d gotten bored of all this adult talk. Aunt Esther left next  mumbling some poor excuse while chewing fiercely on her last antacid tablet.David and Ella remained at the table  an intense awkwardness hanging in the air between them. It pained Ella to have to face this void  which  as they both knew  had nothing to do with Jeannette or any of their children.David grabbed the fork he had put aside and inspected it for a while. “So should I conclude that you didn’t marry the man you loved?”“Oh  please  that’s not what I meant.”“What is it you meant  then?” David said  still talking to the fork. “I thought you were in love with me when we got married.”“I was in love with you ” Ella said  but couldn’t help adding  “back then.”“So when did you stop loving me?” David asked  deadpan.Ella looked at her husband in astonishment  like someone who had never seen her reflection before and who now held a mirror to her face. Had she stopped loving him? It was a question she had never asked herself before. She wanted to respond but lacked not so much the will as the words. Deep inside she knew it was the two of them they should be concerned about  not their children. But instead they were doing what they both were best at: letting the days go by  the routine take over  and time run its course of inevitable torpor.She started to cry  unable to hold back this continuing sadness that had  without her knowledge  become a part of who she was. David turned his anguished face away. They both knew he hated to see her cry just as much as she hated to cry in front of him. Fortunately  the phone rang just then  saving them.David picked it up. “Hello . . . yes  she’s here. Hold on  please.”Ella pulled herself together and spoke up  doing her best to sound in good spirits. “Yes  this is Ella.”“Hi  this is Michelle. Sorry to bother you over the weekend ” chirped a young woman’s voice. “It’s just that yesterday Steve wanted me to check in with you  and I simply forgot. Did you have a chance to start working on the manuscript?”“Oh.” Ella sighed  only now remembering the task awaiting her.Her first assignment at the literary agency was to read a novel by an unknown European author. She was then expected to write an extensive report on it.“Tell him not to worry. I’ve already started reading ” Ella lied. Ambitious and headstrong  Michelle was the kind of person she didn’t want to upset on her first assignment.“Oh  good! How is it?”Ella paused  puzzled as to what to say. She didn’t know anything about the manuscript  except that it was a historical novel centered on the life of the famous mystic poet Rumi  who she learned was called “the Shakespeare of the Islamic world.”“Oh  it’s very . . . mystical.” Ella chuckled  hoping to cover with a joke.But Michelle was all business. “Right ” she said flatly. “Listen  I think you need to get on this. It might take longer than you expect to write a report on a novel like that. . . . ”There was a distant muttering on the phone as Michelle’s voice trailed off. Ella imagined her juggling several tasks simultaneously—checking e-mails  reading a review on one of her authors  taking a bite from her tuna-salad sandwich  and polishing her fingernails—all while talking on the phone.“Are you still there?” Michelle asked a minute later.“Yes  I am.”“Good. Listen  it’s crazy in here. I need to go. Just keep in mind the deadline is in three weeks.”“I know ” Ella said abruptly  trying to sound more determined. “I’ll make the deadline.”The truth was  Ella wasn’t sure she wanted to evaluate this manuscript at all. In the beginning she’d been so eager and confident. It had felt thrilling to be the first one to read an unpublished novel by an unknown author and to play however small a role in his fate. But now she wasn’t sure if she could concentrate on a subject as irrelevant to her life as Sufism and a time as distant as the thirteenth century.Michelle must have detected her hesitation. “Is there a problem?” she asked. When no answer came  she grew insistent. “Listen  you can confide in me.”After a bit of silence  Ella decided to tell her the truth.“It’s just that I’m not sure I’m in the right state of mind these days to concentrate on a historical novel. I mean  I’m interested in Rumi and all that  but still  the subject is alien to me. Perhaps you could give me another novel—you know  something I could more easily relate to.”“That’s such a skewed approach ” said Michelle. “You think you can work better with books you know something about? Not at all! Just because you live in this state  you can’t expect to edit only novels that take place in Massachusetts  right?”“That’s not what I meant . . .” Ella said  and immediately realized she had uttered the same sentence too many times this afternoon. She glanced at her husband to see if he  too  had noticed this  but David’s expression was hard to decipher.“Most of the time  we have to read books that have nothing to do with our lives. That’s part of our job. Just this week I finished working on a book by an Iranian woman who used to operate a brothel in Tehran and had to flee the country. Should I have told her to send the manuscript to an Iranian agency instead?”“No  of course not ” Ella mumbled  feeling silly and guilty.“Isn’t connecting people to distant lands and cultures one of the strengths of good literature?”“Sure it is. Listen  forget what I said. You’ll have a report on your desk before the deadline ” Ella conceded  hating Michelle for treating her as if she were the dullest person alive and hating herself for allowing this to happen.“Wonderful  that’s the spirit ” Michelle concluded in her singsong voice. “Don’t get me wrong  but I think you should bear in mind that there are dozens of people out there who would love to have your job. And most of them are almost half your age. That’ll keep you motivated.”When Ella hung up the phone  she found David watching her  his face solemn and reserved. He seemed to be waiting for them to pick up where they’d left off. But she didn’t feel like mulling over their daughter’s future anymore  if that was what they’d been worrying about in the first place.Later in the day  she was alone on the porch sitting in her favorite rocking chair  looking at the orangey-red Northampton sunset. The sky felt so close and open that you could almost touch it. Her brain had gone quiet  as if tired of all the noise swirling inside. This month’s credit-card payments  Orly’s bad eating habits  Avi’s poor grades  Aunt Esther and her sad cakes  her dog Spirit’s decaying health  Jeannette’s marriage plans  her husband’s secret flings  the absence of love in her life . . . One by one  she locked them all in small mental boxes.In that frame of mind  Ella took the manuscript out of its package and bounced it in her hand  as if weighing it. The title of the novel was written on the cover in indigo ink: Sweet Blasphemy.Ella had been told that nobody knew much about the author—a certain A. Z. Zahara  who lived in Holland. His manuscript had been shipped to the literary agency from Amsterdam with a postcard inside the envelope. On the front of the postcard was a picture of tulip fields in dazzling pinks  yellows  and purples  and on the back a note written in delicate handwriting:Dear Sir/Madam  Greetings from Amsterdam. The story I herewith send you takes place in thirteenth-century Konya in Asia Minor. But I sincerely believe that it cuts across countries  cultures  and centuries.I hope you will have the time to read SWEET BLASPHEMY  a historical  mystical novel on the remarkable bond between Rumi  the best poet and most revered spiritual leader in the history of Islam  and Shams of Tabriz  an unknown  unconventional dervish full of scandals and surprises.May love be always with you and you always surrounded with love.A. Z. Zahara"

"Phantoms in the Brain From the Back Cover Phantoms In The Brain  using a series of case histories  introduces strange and unexplored mental worlds. Ramachandran  through his research into brain damage  has discovered that the brain is continually organising itself in response to change. A woman maintains that her left arm is not paralysed  a young man loses his right arm in a motorcycle accident  yet he continues to feel a phantom arm with vivid sensation of movement. In a series of experiments using nothing more than Q-tips and dribbles of warm water the young man helped Ramachandran discover how the brain is remapped after injury. Ramachandran believes that cases such as these illustrate fundamental principles of how the human brain operates. The brain ‘needs to create a ""script"" or a story to make sense of the world  a unified and internally consistent belief system.’Ramachandran’s radical new approach will have far-reaching effects. About the Author Dr Vilayanur Ramachandran is professor of Neuroscience and Psychology at UC San Diego. He is a leader in the field of brain research. He has published over 80 papers  edited a 4-volume Encyclopedia of Human Behavior and has appeared on numerous TV programmes. Sandra Blakeslee is an award-winning science writer for the NY Times."

A HISTORY OF NINETEENTH CENTURY LITERATURE (1780-1895) In the execution of the present task some difficulties occurred which did not present themselves to the author when he undertook the volume of Elizabethan Literature  or to his immediate predecessor in grappling with the period between 1660 and 1780.To provide room for the greater press of material  it was necessary to make some slight changes of omission in the scheme of the earlier volumes. It seemed not necessary to take up room with the bibliographical index  as this would have had to be greatly more voluminous here  and it was much less necessary. With a very few exceptions  all the writers here included are either kept in print  or can be obtained without much trouble at the second-hand bookshops.In the circumstances  and with a view to avoid not merely repetition but confusion and dislocation in the body of the book  the author had thought it better to make the conclud­ing chapter one of considerably greater length than the corresponding part of the Elizabethan volume  and to reserve for it the greater part of what may be called con­necting and comprehensive criticism.

"In Europe's Shadow: Two Cold Wars and a Thirty-Year Journey Through Romania and Beyond Review “[A] haunting yet ultimately optimistic examination of the human condition as found in Romania . . . The author delves into the ancient roots of Romania’s culture and religion. . . . [Robert D.] Kaplan’s account of the centuries leading up to the most turbulent of all—the twentieth—is both sweeping and replete with alluring detail. . . . The rich characters who wander through these pages . . . dispense wisdom from book-lined homes  cafes  or chapels old and new. . . . Kaplan’s Romania offers lessons on the value of malleability  and what ­endures.”—Alison Smale  The New York Times Book Review“This book reveals the confident  poetical Kaplan . . . but also a reflective  political Kaplan  seeking at times to submerge his gift for romantic generalization in respectful attention to the ideas of others. That tension—between an aesthetic sense of wholeness and the intellectual acceptance of complexity—is the real subject of the book  both as autobiography and as geopolitics.”—Timothy Snyder  The Washington Post “A serious yet impassioned survey of Romania . . . [Kaplan’s] method is that of a foreign correspondent  firing off dispatches from the South China Sea to North Yemen to the darkest corners of Eastern Europe when it was still Iron Curtain country  and his approach has a Thucydidean texture: a gimlet-eyed realism as gathered by evidence  and guided by an understanding that the knee-jerk of history is self-interest. . . . Kaplan is a regional geographer par excellence—undeniably  whatever you think of his conclusions—a big-picture man.”—The Christian Science Monitor “Kaplan is one of America’s foremost writers on the region. . . . In a series of deep dives into the region’s past—Byzantine  Ottoman  Habsburg and Soviet—he finds parallels and echoes that help us understand the present.”—The Wall Street Journal   “Kaplan moves seamlessly from sights  sounds  and conversations to the resonance of history. . . . In Kaplan’s hands  Romania emerges as no mere footnote  but as a historical and political pivot.”—Foreign Affairs “Kaplan’s work exemplifies rare intellectual  moral and political engagement with the political order—and disorder—of our world. . . . Kaplan’s writing is like the places he visits. It’s a terrain  a concentrated expression of a particular part of the world as he sees it. . . . In Europe’s Shadow amounts to a kind of historical anthropology plus geopolitics  a deep study of a particular country and people. . . . It shows how  at one and the same time  Romania is distinctive and a key to a broader and deeper understanding of contemporary Europe.”—The Huffington Post“Kaplan’s is travel writing at its contemporary finest  weaving in the sights and sounds of a faraway land alongside interviews with its philosophers and politicians. . . . [In Europe’s Shadow] provides an incisive  tactile introduction to the politics and potential prospects of Central and Southeastern Europe—a region that finds itself once again caught in the headwinds of history.”—RealClearWorld“A masterly work of important history  analysis  and prophecy about the ancient and modern rise of Romania as a roundabout between Russia and Europe . . . I learned something new on every page. Robert D. Kaplan is a master.”—Tom Brokaw   “A tour de force of cultural and political travel writing in which Romania’s complex past and uncertain present become vivid and newly urgent.”—Colin Thubron  author of Shadow of the Silk Road and co-editor of Patrick Leigh Fermor’s The Broken Road   “Robert D. Kaplan has the remarkable ability to see over the geopolitical horizon  and he now turns his attention to Europe’s marchlands—the former ‘Greater Romania’ lying between the Balkans and a resurgent Russia. In a triple journey through books  landscapes  and histories  he tackles the meaning of geography  the influence of intellectuals  and the daffiness—and power—of nationalism. . . . Timely  insightful  and deeply honest.”—Charles King  professor of international affairs  Georgetown University  and author of Midnight at the Pera Palace: The Birth of Modern Istanbul   “For an appreciation of contemporary Romanian attitudes  Robert Kaplan’s book has no equal. As an outsider  yet within  the author offers an analysis of Romania that combines erudition and authority. His sparkling  suggestive reflections  drawing upon history and landscape  capture the DNA of the country and its inhabitants.”—Dennis Deletant  Ion Rațiu Visiting Professor of Romanian Studies  Georgetown University  and emeritus professor  University College London   “A moving book—an illuminating and compassionate guide through the labyrinth of Romania’s immensely convoluted and often traumatic past . . . In spite of the many dark  distressing moments that no one should ignore  In Europe’s Shadow conveys a sense of hope  promise  and continuous renewal.”—Vladimir Tismăneanu  professor of politics  University of Maryland  and author of The Devil in History: Communism  Fascism  and Some Lessons of the Twentieth Century   “Kaplan illuminates the extraordinary journey of the people of Romania  as well as millions of other East Europeans  from the tragic Soviet despotism of the decades after the Second World War to their more hopeful and democratic future as members of NATO and the European Union. Kaplan’s ability to weave together complex histories  religion  memory  and political thought is nearly unmatched.”—Nicholas Burns  professor  Harvard Kennedy School  and former undersecretary of state for political affairs   “A favorite of mine for years  Robert D. Kaplan is a thoughtful and insight-driven historian who writes clear and compelling prose  but what I like most about him is his political sophistication. In Europe’s Shadow makes you look up and think about what’s on the page—a true pleasure for the reader.”—Alan FurstFrom the Hardcover edition.  About the Author Robert D. Kaplan is the bestselling author of sixteen books on foreign affairs and travel that have been translated into many languages  including Asia’s Cauldron  The Revenge of Geography  Monsoon  The Coming Anarchy  and Balkan Ghosts. He is a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security and a contributing editor at The Atlantic  where his work has appeared for three decades.

"Pachinko Review 'A sweeping  engrossing family saga ... a poignantly told tale. Gracefully written and dotted with memorable images  evocative of the pace and time  it's a page-turning panorama of one family's path through suffering to prosperity in 20th-century Japan' Literary Review. 'A rich  moving novel about exile  identity and the determination to endure' Sunday Times. 'Wonderful  in scope  scale and the beauty of storytelling' Nicola Sturgeon. 'An exquisite  haunting epic ... Lee's profound novel of losses and gains explored through the social and cultural implications of pachinko-parlor owners and users is shaped by impeccable research  meticulous plotting  and empathic perception' Booklist Starred Review. '[A] beautifully crafted story of love  loss determination  luck  and perseverance ... Lee's skilful development of her characters and story lines will draw readers into the work. Those who enjoy historical fiction with strong characterisations will not be disappointed as they ride along on the emotional journeys offered in the author's latest page-turner' Library Journal. 'Love  luck  and talent combine with cruelty and random misfortune in a deeply compelling story  with the troubles of ethnic Koreans living in Japan never far from view. An old-fashioned epic whose simple  captivating storytelling delivers both wisdom and truth' Kirkus. 'A compassionate  clear gaze at the chaotic landscape of life itself. In this haunting epic tale  no one story seems too minor to be briefly illuminated. Lee suggests that behind the facades of wildly different people lie countless private desires  hopes and miseries  if we have the patience and compassion to look and listen' New York Times Book Review. 'Both for those who love Korea  as well as for those who know no more than Hyundai  Samsung and kimchi  this extraordinary book will prove a revelation of joy and heartbreak. I could not stop turning the pages  and wished this most poignant of sagas would never end. Min Jin Lee displays a tenderness and wisdom ideally matched to an unforgettable tale that she relates just perfectly' Simon Winchester  author of Korea: A Walk Through the Land of Miracles. 'Elegant and soulful  both intimate and sweeping. This story of several generations of one Korean family in Japan is the story of every family whose parents sacrificed for their children  every family whose children were unable to recognize the cost  but it's also the story of a specific cultural struggle in a riveting time and place. Min Jin Lee has written a big  beautiful book filled with characters I rooted for and cared about and remembered after I'd read the final page' Kate Christensen  award-winning author of The Great Man and Blue Plate Special. 'Remarkable ... A striking introduction to lives  to a world  [the reader] may never have seen  or even thought to look at. In our increasingly fractured and divisive times  there can be no higher purpose for literature: all in the pages of a book that  once you've started  you'll simply be unable to put down' Harper's Bazaar. 'A long  complex book  it wears its research lightly  and is a page-turner. You can sense the author's love and understanding for all the characters  the good and the flawed' Irish Examiner. 'A great book  a passionate story  a novel of magisterial sweep. It's also fiendishly readable - the real deal. An instant classic  a quick page-turner  and probably the best book of the year' Darin Strauss  New York Times-bestselling author of Chang and Eng. 'An epic  multi-generational saga' Mail on Sunday  Best of 2017. 'We never feel history being spoon-fed to us: it is wholly absorbed into character and story  which is no mean feat for a novel covering almost a century of history' Financial Times. 'The work of a writer in complete control of her characters and her story and with an intense awareness of the importance of her heritage ... Told with such flair and linguistic dexterity that I found myself unable to put it down. Every year  there are a few standout novels that survive long past the hype has died down and the hyperbolic compliments from friends scattered across the dust jacket have been forgotten. Pachinko  a masterpiece of empathy  integrity and familial loyalty  will be one of those novels' John Boyne  Irish Times. 'Gripping ... a stunning achievement  full of heart  full of grace  full of truth' Erica Wagner. 'A long novel  but it never feels it - Min Jin Lee's storytelling is effortless' Stylist  Pick of the best new books for 2017. 'Luminous ... a powerful meditation on what immigrants sacrifice to achieve a home in the world' Junot Diaz. 'A deep  broad  addictive history of a Korean family in Japan enduring and prospering through the 20th century' David Mitchell  Guardian. 'Stunning ... Pachinko is about outsiders  minorities and the politically disenfranchised. But it is so much more besides. Each time the novel seems to find its locus - Japan's colonization of Korea  World War II as experienced in East Asia  Christianity  family  love  the changing role of women - it becomes something else. It becomes even more than it was' New York Times. 				    	 					 About the Author Min Jin Lee is a Korean-American author and journalist.

"The Interpretation of Dreams (Modern Library) From the Back Cover Freud's discovery that the dream is the means by which the unconscious can be explored is undoubtedly the most revolutionary step forward in the entire history of psychology. Dreams  according to his theory  represent the hidden fulfillment of our unconscious wishes. 				    	 					 About the Author Sigmund Freud was born in 1856 in Moravia  Austrian Empire (now the Czech Republic). Between the ages of four and eighty-two his home was in Vienna  in 1938 Hitler's invasion of Austria forced him to seek asylum in London  where he died in the following year.His career began with several years of brilliant work on the anatomy and physiology of the nervous system. He was almost thirty when  after a period of study under Charcot in Paris  his interests first turned to psychology  and another ten years of clinical work in Vienna (at first in collaboration with Breuer  an older colleague) saw the birth of his creation  psychoanalysis. This began simply as a method of treating neurotic patients by investigating their minds  but it quickly grew into an accumulation of knowledge about the workings of the mind in general  whether sick or healthy. Freud was thus able to demonstrate the normal development of the sexual instinct in childhood and  largely on the basis of an examination of dreams  arrived at his fundamental discovery of the unconscious forces that influence our everyday thoughts and actions. Freud's life was uneventful  but his ideas have shaped not only many specialist disciplines  but the whole intellectual climate of the last half century.

"Mathematics for the Non-mathematician (Dover Books on Mathematics) About the Author   Morris Kline: Mathematics for the Masses Morris Kline (1908–1992) had a strong and forceful personality which he brought both to his position as Professor at New York University from 1952 until his retirement in 1975  and to his role as the driving force behind Dover's mathematics reprint program for even longer  from the 1950s until just a few years before his death. Professor Kline was the main reviewer of books in mathematics during those years  filling many file drawers with incisive  perceptive  and always handwritten comments and recommendations  pro or con. It was inevitable that he would imbue the Dover math program ― which he did so much to launch ― with his personal point of view that what mattered most was the quality of the books that were selected for reprinting and the point of view that stressed the importance of applications and the usefulness of mathematics. He urged that books should concentrate on demonstrating how mathematics could be used to solve problems in the real world  not solely for the creation of intellectual structures of theoretical interest to mathematicians only.  Morris Kline was the author or editor of more than a dozen books  including Mathematics in Western Culture (Oxford  1953)  Mathematics: The Loss of Certainty (Oxford  1980)  and Mathematics and the Search for Knowledge (Oxford  1985). His Calculus  An Intuitive and Physical Approach  first published in 1967 and reprinted by Dover in 1998  remains a widely used text  especially by readers interested in taking on the sometimes daunting task of studying the subject on their own. His 1985 Dover book  Mathematics for the Nonmathematician could reasonably be regarded as the ultimate math for liberal arts text and may have reached more readers over its long life than any other similarly directed text.  In the Author's Own Words:""Mathematics is the key to understanding and mastering our physical  social and biological worlds.""  ""Logic is the art of going wrong with confidence.""  ""Statistics: the mathematical theory of ignorance.""  ""A proof tells us where to concentrate our doubts."" ― Morris Kline"

"The Evolution Of Gods : The Scientific Origin Of Divinity And Religion Review I liked this book very much. Since my childhood  I was much skeptical and confused about gods and their roles in our life. Whether some divine power created and nourished humans or this dogma was a human projection. I always asked if one God made us then why He created poor & rich  beautiful & ugly and so on. This book taught me that all gods are imaginary and made by us for our convenience. The author has provided several interesting evidence to support his main argument that humans created gods. He has discussed prehistoric religion to depict how humanity would have invented gods. He has mentioned a brief history of religions to explain how we built religions. This book has one amazing chapter to discuss the problems created by religions for modern humans. The book has a lot of great and altogether new ideas. --Radha Krishna Jan 11  2013I rarely write a review  even then I am writing  since I absolutely loved this book. I am surprised to read the contents  which are altogether new. This book has compiled several religious practices prevalent during the prehistoric and historic time. After reading those  a clear cut picture appears how and why humans would have created or imagined their gods. Humans imagined and worshipped the divine powers or gods in order to explain their mysteries and miseries. The author has established that religions caused and nourished the most common human miseries like women exploitation  poverty  slavery  Tantar-Mantra and several diseases. I have been a devotee  but certainly have problems with several aspects of religions. This wonderful book has explained almost all my previous questions and specially the impact of the concept of gods on humans today. This book has shattered my faith. It is a painful experience to know that all religious dogmas and gods are an illusion. Now  I do not have an imaginary savior to protect me. Yes  if my savior was my imagination or illusion then this book have done a great job to open my eyes. In the long run this may help me  since I would now believe myself only --Ayush Mittal Feb 1  2013The Title says it all. We heard about evolution of organisms and mankind before but this time Gods have been proved to be evolved. Such kind of books should be included in school text-books so that the young minds can set themselves free. The author never becomes judgmental at any point. He just provide details with solid & concrete evidences. --Manjil Mukherjee Sep 13  2012 				    	 					 Book Description The Evolution of Gods: The Scientific Origin of Divinity and Religions Did gods create mankind  or did mankind create gods? Why  when and how did mankind begin to worship gods? Religious scriptures the world over claim that one or the other god made all plants and animals  but science has not yet identified any supernatural power that created and governed living beings. Was it man who came up with the idea of gods to help him cope with his own fears? Could it be that ancient people attributed natural phenomena-unfathomable and frightening to them-to the working of invisible gods? What kind of sufferings or fears made people bow before unseen powers or gods as we call them? When were these gods created? Who invented morals and methods of worship? Who wrote the ancient scriptures such as the Bible and the Vedas? Most crucially  have gods and the scriptures shaped our responses to the world around us? The Evolution of Gods seeks to answer these questions  and explains scientifically how  when and why religions and gods came into being. Ajay Kansal marshals anthropological and historical facts about the development of religions in a simple and straight forward manner to assert that it was mankind that created gods  and not the other way around.

"The 33 Strategies of War About the Author Robert Greene is the author of the New York Times bestsellers Mastery  The 48 Laws of Power  The Art of Seduction  The 33 Strategies of War  and The 50th Law. Robert attended U.C. Berkeley and the University of Wisconsin at Madison  where he received a degree in classical studies. He currently lives in Los Angeles. 				    	 					 From AudioFile The classical scholar and author says that war occurs in five contexts--when we execute it individually  with an army of some kind  from an offensive position  from a defensive position  and through unconventional  or dirty  means. The suggestions and ideas behind this lesson are thoroughly illustrated with concise historical vignettes. Deftly balancing theory and practice  the author asks listeners to examine their options for handling conflict  understand the meaning of their past experiences  and commit themselves fully to a mature and appropriate response to conflict. He has an impressive understanding of the psychological and organizational challenges in warfare. Don Leslie gives a softly intimate reading that sounds aptly erudite but not overly intense. Pacing himself steadily  he organizes the thick sentences and dense ideas with finesse. T.W. © AudioFile 2008  Portland  Maine-- Copyright © AudioFile  Portland  Maine"

"Light on Yoga: The Classic Guide to Yoga by the World's Foremost Authority Review 'Light on Yoga' is not the same book as 'Light on the Yoga Sutras Of Patanjali'. Some of the 1-star reviews seem to be confusing these two books - perhaps a mixup by flipkart? 'Light on Yoga' deals with asanas more (physical aspect of yoga) while 'Light on the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali' deals more with philosophy. This review is of the former 'Light on Yoga' book which deals with the physical aspects. This book is popularly known as a definitive guide for the practice of the physical aspects of Yoga - Yoga Asanas  and with good reason - it most certainly deserves this popularity. The book starts with a few pages devoted to the philosophy and history of Yoga  and later  dives straight into the exposition of various Yoga poses - Asanas. For each Asana  it follows the following pattern. The Sanskrit name of the Asana is mentioned  followed by a difficulty rating on the scale of one through sixty  followed by the plate number of the photograph(s) showing that Asana. There is at least one photograph of each Asana  the difficult ones have multiple photographs. After this  a brief English explanation of the origin and name of the Asana is given  followed by step by step instructions on the technique for performing the Asana correctly. Common errors and suggested corrections are mentioned for some Asanas. Sometimes  multiple ways of attaining the same final Asana are mentioned - some to be followed by a beginner while some to be followed by an advanced pupil. After this  the claimed effects of that Asana are mentioned. The book also has brief sections on Yoga Bandha and Kriya  and also on Pranayama. However  the primary focus of the book seems to be on Asanas. It also has has a three hundred week suggested course for pupils to follow  with details given of which Asanas to do in which week. Other than this  a claimed list of curative Asanas for various ailments  a table correlating the name of the Asana with the plate number of its photograph  and a glossary of terms is given. To summarize  the book appears to be very useful to anyone who wishes to do Yoga Asanas seriously. --Narayan Kulkarni Jan 9  2012An absolute must for anyone who practices yoga seriously.It has many variations and step by step guidlines of how to get into the more advanced poses.All poses have pictures the meaning of the postures(the story behind the name) technique effects and limitations.This book is a bible for yogis!!!!!! When i did my teacher training it was a must have book ! --ek yogini Sep 4  2011Very knowledgeable book in theory. Should ideally practice with a seasoned yoga teacher keeping in mind all the do's and dont's. --asheesh kapur Feb 25  2014 				    	 					 About the Author About the Author: One of the world's most renowned and respected yoga guru B. K. S. Iyengar has previously written books like The Art of Yoga  The Tree of Yoga  Pranayama and others. His dedication towards practicing and teaching yoga led him to receive the prestigious Padma Shri in 1991 and Padma Bhushan in 2002.

"The Beginner's Guide to Counselling & Psychotherapy Review Written by established leaders in the field and talented (relative) newcomers  this book is a comprehensive introduction to the wider field of counselling and psychotherapy and as such will be useful to trainees across a range of the psychological professions. The chapters on diversity  research and professional issues are a crucial and welcome addition to the field and should enable practitioners to recognise their wider role in clients’ lives. (Professor Martin Milton)This work provides an exemplary introduction to the field of counselling and psychotherapy.  An impressively wide range of theoretical modalities are covered in a svelte manner that recommends this text as both a sound resource for beginner counsellors and psychotherapists as well as a valuable reference for seasoned practitioners.  Of particular recommendation is the manner in which the text aids the reader in understanding how these modalities fit into the broader field.  This is done through effective introductions and examinations of topics such as the therapeutic relationship  relationships among different approaches and through the exploration of contemporary research and practice issues.  It is undoubtedly a text that one will want on their shelves for ready and repeated use. (Dr. Graham du Plessis)Incorporating contributions from key figures with in the counselling field  this book provides an excellent introduction to the diversity of counselling approaches that underpin contemporary practice.  It also addresses important issues such as the significance of research  diversity counselling and the maintenance and development of professional and ethical practice. Authoritative but accessible  it is a valuable introductory text for trainee counsellors and prospective clients alike  as well as a useful resource for  practitioners wishing to keep abreast of wider developments within the counselling world.     (Dr Liz Ballinger)There is a great need for textbooks that help students and practitioners make sense of all the different approaches to counselling and psychotherapy. The second edition of Stephen Palmers' book helps us do that. The case studies at the end of each chapter help bring it all to life especially as they are written by those who actually apply the various theories day to day.    I also liked the way that differing approaches to CBT were treated separately rather than lumped together as they are in some introductory texts. Other useful additions are the chapters outlining a pluralist approach to the therapeutic relationship and overviews of professional issues  research and diversity issues.      (Simon O'Donohoe)This book makes a solid contribution to the literature on counselling and psychotherapy  underpinned by the rich expertise and extensive professional experience of the many authors. Stephen Palmer has done an excellent job in editing an accessible yet wide-ranging coverage of the field.  This text will appeal not just to beginners but also practitioners and other interested readers. I look forward to recommending it to my students.

"Mere Christianity (Collected Letters of C.S. Lewis) Review “As we witness Lewis develop we find that these volumes are working as a kind of unconscious autobiography.” (Books & Culture)“C. S. Lewis understood  like few in the past century  just how deeply faith is both imaginative and rational.” (Christianity Today)“It is not surprising that Lewis’s time-proven views are still flourishing while most other mid-20th-century works are nearly neglected.” (Wall Street Journal) 				    	 					 From the Back Cover One of the most popular introductions to Christian faith ever written  Mere Christianity has sold millions of copies worldwide. The book brings together C. S. Lewis's legendary broadcast talks of the war years  talks in which he set out simply to ""explain and defend the belief that has been common to nearly all Christians at all times."" Rejecting the boundaries that divide Christianity's many de-nominations  Lewis provides an unequaled opportunity for believers and nonbelievers alike to hear a powerful  rational case for the Christian faith. It is a collection of scintillating brilliance that remains strikingly fresh for the modern reader and at the same time confirms C. S. Lewis's reputation as one of the leading writers and thinkers of our age.              See all Product description"

The jury is out  but this enlightening  lively and accessible book by a distinguished scientist helps us to assess the odds. (Prof. Martin Rees  Astronomer Royal  cosmology pioneer  author of Our Final Hour)This is a compelling guide to the challenges and choices in our quest for a great future of life  intelligence and consciousness - on Earth and beyond. (Elon Musk  CEO of SpaceX and Tesla Motors)Being an eminent physicist and the leader of the Future of Life Institute has given Max Tegmark a unique vantage point from which to give the reader an inside scoop on the most important issue of our time  in a way that is approachable without being dumbed down. (Jaan Tallinn  co-founder of Skype)Max seeks to facilitate a much wider conversation about what kind of future we  as a species  would want to create. Though the topics he covers - AI  cosmology  values  even the nature of conscious experience - can be fairly challenging  he presents them in an unintimidating manner that invites the reader to form her own opinions. (Prof. Nick Bostrom  Founder of Oxford's Future of Humanity Institute  author of Superintelligence)The unprecedented power unleashed by artificial intelligence means the next decade could be humanity's best - or worst.

How can we grow our prosperity through automation  without leaving people lacking income or purpose? How can we ensure that future AI systems do what we want without crashing  malfunctioning or getting hacked? Should we fear an arms race in lethal autonomous weapons?

"The Greatest Salesman in the World Review The summer after my freshman year in high school  a ton of years ago  I was miserable. I didn't have any new friends at school  I was having a hard time at home  and I was trying to get through everyday with a smile on my face. I took a trip with a bunch of people I didn't know  a 10 day backpacking trip to an island in lake superior. Our guide was a 75 year-old man named Dave. Everyday  Dave read us a chapter from this book  and everyday my respect for him grew. The day I got off the island I bought the book and began my ten month journey through the scrolls it contained. I've followed the instructions  reading each chapter for one month  several times. I've worn out several copies and given away several others. This book profoundly changed my life. Not only am I extraordinarily successful in terms of ""material"" success  but I am happier than I ever imagined it was possible to be several years ago before I went on that island. Buy this book  follow it's instructions  and even if you are never the richest woman or man on earth  you will be among the happiest. --By A Customer on December 11  2000I don't know if I misread the instructions or if I'm the only one who actually followed them. If you follow scroll I  it should take you the better part of a year to finish the rest of the book. Following that  I'm only 2/3rds of the way through scroll II (I got the book a couple of months ago  but didn't consistently follow scroll II daily and at the 16-day mark  decided to start again at day 1). I can definitely say it has changed my life  and even the lives of those around me (most of all a person I work with who is hard to get along with and hence gets along with no one--except  now  me  and it really has seemed to make his attitude at work more positive overall). Though difficult at first  it quickly became easy to apply the first principle  and finally find myself easily ""making people your greatest resource"" as so many *other* authors suggest you do for success in life  although it is not specifically suggested in this book. I have gotten a half dozen new and better job offers in the couple of months since I started the book  accepted one of the first ones and am currently in the process of exploring the others. I see all these ""couldn't put the book down till I finished"" and I think  wow  you went a year with a book in your hand? Personally I'm still in considerable suspense waiting to see what scroll III says  let alone the entire rest of the book! --By A Customer on November 1  1999I can see why some people will give this book less than 5 stars. If you are looking for fancy smancy selling techniques  look elsewhere. This is not about technique  it is about the habits  the character that makes up a great salesman. I first started using this book 9 years ago. I would read a chapter a day  three times a day and cheated by reading ahead. More importantly  I began to make these habits my habits. At that time  my sales were less than satisfactory. Within weeks  my sales climbed and I began winning contest after contest. When people asked me what I was doing  I would pull out this book which I carried with me. Some would leaf through it and giggle. And they wondered why their sales were so low! I also found that when I got sick of this book and felt like I had mastered it  a short while later  my sales fell again. So did my attitude. So I started the process all over again and you guessed it  I started making sales again  this time faster than before. Over the years  I have bought many copies of The Greatest Salesman in The World. Some were dog eared and worn out  some I just lost or sometimes I kept one at the office and one at home. --By Tony DeFrancisco on September 30  2005 				    	 					 About the Author According to the 1930 U.S. Census  Og Mandino was born in Natick  Massachusetts on December 12  1923 to parents Silvio and Margaret Mandino  and was named Augustine after his paternal Italian grandfather.[2][3] Mandino was once the editor of his high school paper and planned to attend the University of Missouri's journalism school When in the summer of 1940  before he was able to enter college  his mother died from a massive heart attack  he decided to work in a paper factory until 1942. Afterward  he joined the United States Army Air Corps where he became a military officer and a bombardier. He flew for thirty bombing missions over Germany on board a B-24 Liberator during World War II.[4] During this time  he flew with fellow pilot and movie star  James Stewart. After his military duties  Mandino became an insurance salesman. One wintry November morning in Cleveland  Mandino contemplated committing suicide. But as he sorted through several books in a library  volumes of self-help  success and motivation books captured Mandino's attention. He selected some titles  went to a table and began reading. Mandino followed his visit to the library with more visits to many other libraries around the United States. He read hundreds of books that dealt with success  a pastime that helped him alleviate his alcoholism. It was in a library in Concord  New Hampshire  where he found W. Clement Stone's classic  Success Through a Positive Mental Attitude  a book that changed Mandino for the better."

"Model Connections: How to Recruit Nude Models  Direct Photo Shoots  and Build Working Relationships About the Author A K Nicholas is an art photographer from the United States who specializes in figurative imagery. A diverse background and traditional art education prompted him to develop a unorthodox aesthetic that blends sensual imagery with a painterly style of manipulated colors. He was introduced to art through museum visits and other cultural experiences in Europe  America  Africa  and Asia. Growing up the Middle East  he saw how women's bodies were hidden from public view. In stark contrast  Europeans mostly lacked prudishness. Compare those to the US  where we have a bifurcated culture: half of us celebrate our beauty while the other half shuns it. He did not become interested in art until high school  taking a surrealism art history class  he realized he could explore art that interested him and began learning painting. His initial training with the nude was figure drawing while studying art in college. His first nude shoot was a complete surprise to him when a classmate in college assumed that his invitation to model meant for her to be nude. Although trained in drawing and painting  photography became his concentration by the conclusion of his art degree. Following art school  he put in his dues clerking and staffing the darkroom of a camera store. In the decades following his first shoot  he has photographed hundreds of nude models for pictorial books  limited edition prints  and his instructional books. In recent years he has dedicated himself full time to being an artist. He collaborates with models to create alternate realities  on what he calls ""a journey with no known destination."" With his passion for sharing knowledge  he writes to help you learn from his experience  including how to avoid some common mistakes and to encourage your creativity"

History Of God: The 4000-Year Quest of Judaism  Christianity  and Islam From Booklist In this impressive work  Armstrong  a former nun  a British journalist  and the author of several books on religion  takes on a weighty topic indeed: the study of monotheism over 4 000 years. Beginning at the beginning (which is not Genesis but rather the cauldron of religions found in the Middle East around 4000 B.C.)  she traces the circuitous road to monotheism  following the plethora of twists and turns along the way. Perhaps most interesting for those of Judeo-Christian heritage are the chapters concerning Islam. Armstrong explains and explores this religion in a way that will enlighten those not familiar with its tenets. Besides discussing the three monotheistic religions  Armstrong also addresses such topics as mysticism  the philosophy of religion  and the death of God. Highly readable and provocative  this is a major contribution to religious studies and belongs on the shelves of most public libraries. Ilene Cooper

History of Indian Archaeology: The Beginning to 1947 Book Summary of AHistory Of Indian Archaeology From The Beginning To 1947 The history of Indian archaeology has not received the academic attention it deserves. It has a number of roots  the earliest of which goes back to the records of European travellers and sailors in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The ideas involved in its steady evolution since the middle of the eighteenth century are interesting in their own right and illuminate the history of the major discoveries and developments of the subject. Concerned with the evolving panorama of the Indian archaeological scene as a whole till 1947  this is the first major work of its kind. The author moves with an easy assurance  clarity and precision over a vast and diverse body of literature. The volume is further enriched by the inclusion of two original documents relating to Alexander Cunningham and Lord Curzon. This is a book which nobody with an interest in South Asian archaeology can possible afford to ignore.

"The Old Man and the Sea Review  Here  for a change  is a fish tale that actually does honor to the author. In fact The Old Man and the Sea revived Ernest Hemingway's career  which was foundering under the weight of such postwar stinkers as Across the River and into the Trees. It also led directly to his receipt of the Nobel Prize in 1954 (an award Hemingway gladly accepted  despite his earlier observation that ""no son of a bitch that ever won the Nobel Prize ever wrote anything worth reading afterwards""). A half century later  it's still easy to see why. This tale of an aged Cuban fisherman going head-to-head (or hand-to-fin) with a magnificent marlin encapsulates Hemingway's favorite motifs of physical and moral challenge. Yet Santiago is too old and infirm to partake of the gun-toting machismo that disfigured much of the author's later work: ""The brown blotches of the benevolent skin cancer the sun brings from its reflection on the tropic sea were on his cheeks. The blotches ran well down the sides of his face and his hands had the deep-creased scars from handling heavy fish on the cords."" Hemingway's style  too  reverts to those superb snapshots of perception that won him his initial fame: Just before it was dark  as they passed a great island of Sargasso weed that heaved and swung in the light sea as though the ocean were making love with something under a yellow blanket  his small line was taken by a dolphin. He saw it first when it jumped in the air  true gold in the last of the sun and bending and flapping wildly in the air.  If a younger Hemingway had written this novella  Santiago most likely would have towed the enormous fish back to port and posed for a triumphal photograph--just as the author delighted in doing  circa 1935. Instead his prize gets devoured by a school of sharks. Returning with little more than a skeleton  he takes to his bed and  in the very last line  cements his identification with his creator: ""The old man was dreaming about the lions."" Perhaps there's some allegory of art and experience floating around in there somewhere--but The Old Man and the Sea was  in any case  the last great catch of Hemingway's career. --James Marcus ""The best story Hemingway has written...No page of this beautiful master-work could have been done better or differently."" (Sunday Times) 				    	 					         		         		         	                  	         		About the Author Ernest Miller Hemingway was born in Chicago in 1899 as the son of a doctor and the second of six children. After a stint as an ambulance driver at the Italian front  Hemingway came home to America in 1919  only to return to the battlefield – this time as a reporter on the Greco-Turkish war – in 1922. Resigning from journalism to focus on his writing instead  he moved to Paris where he renewed his earlier friendship with fellow American expatriates such as Ezra Pound and Gertrude Stein. Through the years  Hemingway travelled widely and wrote avidly  becoming an internationally recognized literary master of his craft. He received the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1954  following the publication of The Old Man and the Sea. He died in 1961."

"Radical: Taking Back Your Faith from the American Dream Review New York Times bestsellerCBA bestsellerECPA bestsellerResponses to Radical“In his compelling new book  Radical  David Platt delivers a powerful picture of the church in America today that  on key points  stands in sharp contrast to what the Bible shows us about the person and purpose of Jesus Christ. David challenges Christians to wake up  trade in false values rooted in the American dream  and embrace the notion that each of us is blessed by God for a global purpose—to make Christ’s glory known to all the nations! This is a must-read for every believer!”—Wess Stafford  president and CEO  Compassion Intl.“We have moved into a generation of young leaders who have a passion to surrender the American dream if necessary in order to embrace fully  compassionately  and wholeheartedly a bigger dream—the Great Commission. I have never been challenged by an author more than I have by David Platt. Read Radical  be blessed  and be changed.”—Johnny Hunt  president  Southern Baptist Convention  and pastor  First Baptist Church of Woodstock“Radical will cause you to bounce on a spectrum between two words: ouch and amen. Tough truths do that. They challenge us to examine our lives and then choose the lasting over the temporary. Read Radical if you’re ready to live differently.”—Gregg Matte  senior pastor  First Baptist Church of Houston“David Platt’s book will leave anyone who sincerely engages with his challenge dissatisfied—and faced with a decision: What will authentic faith look like in my life? This book has the potential to revitalize churches today to practice a radical  biblical lifestyle that can transform society and reach a lost world.”—Jerry Rankin  president  International Mission Board  Southern Baptist Convention“The church of the Lord Jesus has been seduced by a skilled seductress: the American dream. David Platt exposes this enemy of authentic Christianity and provides a way of escape through a radical faith that leads to a radical obedience. I am not the same after reading it. I trust that will also be true for you.”—Daniel L. Akin  president  Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary“It is almost impossible to keep the idols of our own culture from influencing us  whether we want it to happen or not. This is certainly true when it comes to the so-called American dream. We need our eyes opened! We need to be called out! In this challenging and thoughtful book  David Platt shows us the way to live for Someone and something bigger.”—Darrin Patrick  founding pastor  The Journey  St. Louis “Sometimes people will commend a book by saying  ‘You won’t want to put it down.’ I can’t say that about this book. You’ll want to put it down  many times. If you’re like me  as you read David Platt’s Radical  you’ll find yourself uncomfortably targeted by the Holy Spirit. You’ll see just how acclimated you are to the American dream. But you’ll find here another Way  one you know to be true  because you’ve heard it before in the words of the Lord Jesus  perhaps most forcefully in the simple call ‘Follow me.’”—Russell D. Moore  dean  Southern Baptist Theological Seminary “Through solid examination of the Scriptures and compelling testimonies from believers enduring persecution  my friend David Platt pulls back the curtain on subtle dangers weakening the church in our Western culture. Radical is the urgent call we need to care more about the spiritually lost and physically impoverished people of the world.”—Ed Stetzer  president  LifeWay Research  About the Author Dr. David Platt  President of the International Mission Board  is deeply devoted to Christ and His Word. David’s first love in ministry is making disciples  sharing  showing  and teaching God’s Word in everyday life. He has traveled extensively to serve alongside church leaders throughout the United States and around the world.   A life-long learner  David has earned two undergraduate and three advanced degrees.  He holds a Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) and Bachelor of Arts in Journalism (A.B.J.) from the University of Georgia  and a Master of Divinity (M.Div.)

"Who Will Cry When You Die? Review There is no need for me to sing the same paeans that have already been sung for the book  instead i would just like to say that one should read this book while undergoing the darkest phases of life. Human beings are so often thrust into inextricable predicaments  from where there seems to be no escape and the advent of the light to pierce through the all pervasive darkness seems highly improbable . This is the book that can bring that much required 'light' into anybody's life  and for people stuck in a crisis the book ought to act like a magic potion - it did so for me! --Debotosh Chatterjee Jun 9  2013We all love and admire self-help books but usually the ""impact"" of any such book fades away after a particular period of time. These books bring us on right track of handling and managing things  relations etc. but soon we fell off the track and succumb to our normal routine and usual behaviour. But this book has more potential to always keep you awake with its simple daily dose of ""help"". You can literally flip and read any chapter and it will surely beam you.

"Six Characters in Search of an Author and Other Plays (Penguin Modern Classics) Language Notes Text: English (translation) Original Language: Italian 				    	 					 About the Author Luigi Pirandello was born of rich  middle-class parents in Girgenti (Agrigento)  Sicily  on 28 June 1867. As a young man he studied at the Universities of Palermo  Rome  and Bonn  where he gained his doctorate in 1891. His first published work  Mal giocondo (1889)  was a collection of poems. It was followed by other volumes of poems  critical essays  novels  short stories  and over forty plays. In 1894 he married Antoinetta Portulano  the daughter of his father's business associate. Financial disaster and a severe illness brought on by the birth of their third child drove his wife to a hysterical form of insanity. Only in 1918  when her presence in the family constituted a real threat to their daughter's safety did Pirandello agree to have his wife committed to an asylum. The enormous emotional strain he felt at this time is reflected in the intense pessimism found in his work. Pirandello's first real success in the theatre came about in 1921 when Six Characters in Search of an Author was performed. Henry IV followed the next year and confirmed his position as a playwright. In the following years Pirandello travelled abroad extensively. He embarked on a career as a producer and in 1925 founded his Art Theatre in Rome. He was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1934 and died in Rome on 10 December 1936.Mark Musa is a professor at the Center for Italian Studies at Indiana University. A former Fulbright and Guggenheim Fellow  Musa is the author of a highly acclaimed translation of Dante's Divine Comedy."
Option B: Facing Adversity  Building Resilience  and Finding Joy Review “A remarkable achievement: generous  honest  poignant. Option B reveals an aspect of Sandberg’s character—her impulse to be helpful. This is a book that will be quietly passed from hand to hand  and it will surely offer great comfort to its intended readers . . . The candor and simplicity with which she shared all of it is a kind of gift . . . Helpful  moving.” —Caitlin Flanagan  The New York Times “The overwhelming message of this book is: We’re a lot more resilient than we think we are. But there are things we can do for ourselves  and for other people who are hurting  that will really allow that resilience to bloom.” —Katie Couric “Sandberg is wise and honest and funny and practical in ways that are likely to stay with the reader. Her deeply personal book is more than memoir  interspersed with devastating scenes are equally powerful strategies for coping when your world has gone tilt.” —Tracy Grant  The Washington Post  “I recommend this inspiring book to everyone around the world. None of us can escape sadness  loss  or life’s disappointments  so the best option is to find our Option B.” —Malala Yousafzai  Nobel Peace Prize winner   “Option B is as hopeful as it is heartbreaking. Here are stories of sometimes unimaginable pain and loss  but also of how human beings nonetheless have the capacity to endure and even thrive. This book is not just an absorbing read. It also provides lessons that everyone needs to learn.” —Atul Gawande  author of Being Mortal “Sheryl writes about her own heartbreaking experience with a rare honesty. Then she and Adam translate her personal story into a powerful  practical guide for anyone trying to build resilience in their own lives  communities  and companies. It’s hard enough to resonate with readers. It’s even harder to help them take concrete steps toward a better future. Option B does both.” —Bill and Melinda Gates  co-chairs of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation  “Thoughtful  insightful  and compelling. Both individually and collectively  we all need to understand the power of rehabilitation  recovery  and redemption if we are to overcome adversity. This incredible book doesn’t avoid the loss and tragedy we all sometimes encounter  but it is animated by a resolve that is both inspiring and instructive.” —Bryan Stevenson  author of Just Mercy and founder of the Equal Justice Initiative    “Illuminating  original  and deeply inspiring  Option B is one part riveting memoir  one part heal-your-heart boot camp  one part stories of others who learned to thrive in the face of profound loss: a practical  vital contribution to the literature on loss and resilience.” —Cheryl Strayed  author of Wild  “Like her debut volume  Sandberg’s Option B is an optimistic book  even if one riven with sorrow. She argues that after adversity and loss  there is an opportunity for ‘post-traumatic growth.’ Thus the book is in part a moving memoir.” —Rebecca Mead  The New Yorker    “Sandberg’s new book is tough  full of the raw  painful emotions . . . Option B [has] advice for people who are grieving. But it’s also a book for nearly everyone—people who may not know what to say or do in the wake of a tragedy. It’s also a deeply optimistic book  framed around the question  what’s next?” —Rebecca J. Rosen  The Atlantic    “Intimate  personal . . . Within Option B there are lessons for leaders who want to make organizations more resilient  help employees recover from a loss—or crisis—and create workplaces that are more prepared to deal with failure.” —Jena McGregor  The Los Angeles Times   “Admirably honest  optimistic . . . Sandberg shares a great deal of herself and what she has learned. At its core the book helps those who have been felled by despair: a guide both for those who have directly suffered loss and for those who are close to people who have.” —The Economist  “Though it was inspired by a deeply personal tragedy  Option B details Sandberg’s experience and the topic of resilience more broadly  and is filled with insight that is useful for anyone overcoming loss or failure.” —Brad Stulberg  New York Magazine “Science of Us” “Being among the most powerful women in the world didn’t spare Sheryl Sandberg from the sudden death of her husband  not quite two years ago. Option B is at its best when pinpointing specific tips for coping with overwhelming grief. Sandberg writes how she created new rituals  such as taking a moment at dinner each evening to express gratitude for something positive that day  and declaring ‘small wins.’ Day by day  the book says  these small victories can become building blocks to a return to emotional equanimity.” —Diane Cole  The Wall Street Journal  “Option B tackles a universal subject  and offers up a path to happiness based not on fantasies of immortality but on the reality of the sorrow of life itself . . . The book is also a practical guide for handling grief and adversity. With her coauthor Grant  Sandberg lays out anecdotes and research on perseverance and resilience . . . Finding growth and ultimately joy is the project of Option B. Sandberg makes a point of emphasizing this aspect.” —Emily Peck  The Huffington Post“Part memoir and part operating manual for surviving the hardest moments in our lives  Option B has essential wisdom . . . This book has the power to help heal. What's doubly impressive about Sandberg’s decision to write it: she must have known it required opening herself up to feedback that far exceeds the usual literary criticism.” —Rebecca Ruiz  Mashable “Option B chronicles Sandberg’s devastating loss  her grief and how she emerged from it with a new perspective on life. The most affecting parts of the book recount not just Sandberg's grief  but that of her children . . . ‘Tragedy does not have to be personal  pervasive or permanent  but resilience can be ’ she writes. ‘We can build it and carry it with us throughout our lives.’” —Associated Press “Sandberg is helping people find resilience and meaning in the face of adversity. She says there isn’t one way to grieve  but she’s learned that processing your feelings and not blaming yourself is an important part of recovery. . . Facing adversity  Sandberg says  is a part of daily life from childhood to adulthood.” —Queenie Wong  The Mercury News “Moving . . . A memoir of the loss of a husband and finding a path forward beyond the grieving process. Writing with Grant  a highly rated professor at Wharton  Sandberg explores how to weather the storm of grief  applying concrete skills—in addition to more complex theories of psychology about how to find meaning in life-changing circumstances. A book that provides illuminating ways to make headway through the days when there doesn’t seem to be a way forward.” —Kirkus “Helpful and hopeful Sandberg draws on her own pain around the sudden death of her husband  and shares what she has learned about resilience with a tone that is raw and candid. Those suffering as well as those seeking to provide comfort should find both solace and wisdom” —Publishers Weekly  About the Author SHERYL SANDBERG is chief operating officer at Facebook  overseeing the firm's business operations. Prior to Facebook  Sheryl was vice president of Global Online Sales and Operations at Google  chief of staff for the United States Treasury Department under President Clinton  a management consultant with McKinsey & Company  and an economist with the World Bank.   Sheryl received a BA summa cum laude from Harvard University and an MBA with highest distinction from Harvard Business School.   Sheryl is the co-author of Option B: Facing Adversity  Building Resilience  and Finding Joy with Wharton professor and bestselling author Adam Grant  which will be released April 24  2017.

History of Medical and Spiritual Sciences of Siddhas of Tamil Nadu About the Author Hailing from a family of Siddha medicine practitioners and being influenced by ancient matters from childhood  P Karthigayan  the author  had many pressing questions on creation  nature  gods  fate  etc. His attempts to understand these oft-debated topics related to society led him to be interested in mythologies  folklore  ancient literature  religious scripts  medical notes and finally Siddhas' works  including their seemingly religious renderings. He felt that most of the scripts of Siddhas were not transparent and had some secret teachings interlaced in them that led him to research other spheres of knowledge related to his quest.  His quest for truth in this line of study necessitated him to an in-depth study of Indian  as well as international  mythical works and other related writings with newer insights.  He believes that his writings will enlighten the ones  who seek knowledge in the fields of health care  spiritualism  ancient wisdom  histories of the ancient and mythological times  etc. It would also serve as a valuable reference work on ancient matters.

"Modern Death: How Medicine Changed the End of Life Review ""Haider Warraich's elegant and poignant book takes us on an unforgettable journey. Warraich's quest is remarkable: he wants us to confront the act of dying. A caring and thoughtful doctor  he also writes beautifully―drawing from his own patients and from statistics  medical ethics  literature and the sciences. He succeeds in humanizing a complex topic and gives us remarkable insights about the changing nature of'modern death'.""―Siddhartha Mukherjee  New York Times bestselling author of The Emperor of All Maladies and The Gene""Warraich demystifies what is known and unknown about how cells and bodies die  while sensitively grappling with the changing cultural landscape surrounding the end of life  including patients who tweet and share the details of their decline on social media. His story is filled with compassionate accounts of the different ways he has witnessed people meet death in the modern age.""―Scientific American""Medical advances have shifted the boundary between life and death  raising controversial questions for doctors and patients. Physician Haider Warraich zooms in on these issues in Modern Death: How Medicine Changed the End of Life  supplementing medical history with tales from the life-death border that are disturbing  bewildering  and inspiring.""―Psychology Today""Daily exposure to death and the agonies of the bereaved prompted cardiologist Haider Warraich to encapsulate the recent transformation in end-of-life care. The result is rich  splicing harrowing cases from the acute admissions ward into medical history and science as he examines everything from the death of a cell to the impact of death on society.""―Nature""Dr. Haider Warraich has written an extraordinarily informative and reflective book  deftly balancing historical facts  statistics  humanism and masterful story telling. While reading it  I forgot that the subject matter was death as the pages so educated me and enlivened my spirit. Kudos to Dr. Warraich for penning this gift to the reader―a truly illuminating book. It is a gem  one I shall treasure and share with many.""―Sanjiv Chopra  MD  Professor of Medicine  Harvard Medical School  bestselling author of Live Better  Live Longer""Warraich thoughtfully investigates the often alarming realities of death in early 21st-century America. As Warraich eloquently explores the act of dying  he urges the public to talk more about it and pleads for 'resuscitating many of the aspects of death that we have lost.'”―Publishers Weekly (starred review)""Warraich concludes this sensitive review of a painful subject with guarded optimism that a cultural shift toward open discussion is now occurring. An important contribution to a serious discussion of profound life-and-death issues.""―Kirkus Reviews""Excellent...thoughtful.""―Booklist""While other texts have covered issues of medicine and the end of life  Warraich's goes beyond when discussing the role of the digital sphere plays in grief and memorization. Readers [...] will find an engaging and updated outlook in this work.""―Library Journal""There is no topic more universal―or more universally unnerving―than death. Haider Warrich’s Modern Deathis a much-needed exploration of this treacherous territory  offering clear-eyed analysis of what it means to die in America today and how to focus one’s own life toward a saner and gentler denouement.""―Danielle Ofri  MD  PhD  author of What Patients Say  What Doctors Hear""An omnivorous  fascinating  free-range romp through the history and co-evolution of death and modern medicine. I devoured it in one sitting.""―Katy Butler  New York Times bestselling author of Knocking on Heaven's Door""This book has something valuable to say to every person alive. Blending wisdom  research  and compassion  Dr. Warraich shines a bright light into a dark reality of human existence. The result is nearly encyclopedic  with an illumination on every page.""―Stephen P. Kiernan  author of Last Rights and The Hummingbird""Melding the curiosity of a historian  the discernment of a physician  and the soulfulness of a poet  Haider Warraich provides us a stunning portrait of death in our moment. The modern aspiration to explicate our suffering collides ironically here with an age-old awe at what can only be deeply felt. In revealing just how breathtakingly far science has taken us in understanding the end of life  Dr. Warraich yet honors the fundamental truth that we may never conquer our mortality―and that in dying  we are most fully human.""―Rafael Campo  MD  Associate Professor  Harvard Medical School  and author of Alternative Medicine""From the minutest exploration of how cells die to the larger philosophical questions about life and death  Haider Warraich invites the reader to contemplate the art and science of death and dying. The author brings us through the 'medicalization' of death and returns us to a deep humanity that we seem to have lost along the way. That he does this lyrically and with brilliance  courage  and humility sets this book apart. Modern Death is informative and beautifully written. I couldn’t put it down.""―Eve Joseph  author of In the Slender Margin""Warraich delivers a detailed and data-rich study of the history of human death without avoiding the primary characteristics that define the ends of lives today: denial  inequality  overtreatment  and institutionalization. As a growing elder population and rapidly advancing medical technology continue to warp and change health care  doctors serve as our best scouts and guides. Warraich's rich and thorough Modern Death is a necessary contribution to this important canon.""―Ann Neumann  author of The Good Death: An Exploration of Dying in America""Harder Warraich has looked at modern death with the cool eye of a scientist  and the heart of a humane doctor. It's a wonderful combination of history  anatomy  public policy  and storytelling. A warm and thorough guide to living well all the way to the end.”―Ellen Goodman  Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist and New York Times bestselling author of I Know Just What You Mean and Paper Trail""A contemporary Virgil  Dr. Haider Warraich escorts us through the complicated and messy world of modern death. In a smart  contemplative  and appealingly humble voice  he dissects the mysteries of CPR and DNR  brain death  and slow codes  and exposes the bizarre fact that most hospital deaths are handled by the youngest and least experienced doctors. Ultimately  he guides us back to a place where the take-home message remains the same  that at the end of life  being there - with family  with community  with clarity - is what matters now  and forever.""―Anna Reisman  M.D.  Director  Humanities in Medicine  Yale School of Medicine""Modern Death tells the most compelling story: how something that once seemed so simple ― the difference between life and death ― became so complicated  and so important. Against all odds  Haider Warraich takes on this mammoth subject and explains it with clarity  humor  intelligence and élan. I loved it.""―Daniel Wallace  author of Big Fish""Warraich supplements his research with anecdotes from his personal experience  and draws on literature  theology  statistics and legal theory as well as the hard sciences. The resulting expert opinion is heartfelt  convincing and well informed...a sincere and thorough examination of an often overlooked subject. Well served by Warraich's professional expertise and earnest emphasis  this is an indispensable entry into the conversation about death.""―Shelf Awareness""Warraich has assembled an impressive fund of knowledge on death and dying that--along with his real-world medical experiences―will allow him to 'attend' to his patients in the truest sense of the word."" ―Health Affairs""[Warraich] may not have all the answers  but [he] stimulates all the right questions in all 13 chapters of highly relatable prose."" ―The American Society of Anesthesiologists ""Modern Death  How Medicine Changed the End of Life is timely. [...] He layers an exploration of a complex topics  ranging broadly from the microscope to the intensive care unit  to the courtroom and on to Star Trek: The Next Generation. Through this construction  he presents an ambitious review of how the end of life interacts with our modern practice of medicine."" ―Journal of the American Medical Association: Internal Medicine About the Author Dr. Haider Warraich graduated from medical school in Pakistan in 2009.

"K2: Life and Death on the World's Most Dangerous Mountain About the Author In May 2005 Ed Viesturs became the first American to ascend all fourteen of the world's 8 000-meter peaks. He lives in Bainbridge Island  Washington  with his wife and three children. He still climbs and seeks out new adventures. For more information  visit www.edviesturs.com.DAVID ROBERTS is the author of twenty books on mountaineering  adventure  and history. He has written for National Geographic  National Geographic Adventure  and Smithsonian. He lives in Cambridge  Massachusetts.From the Hardcover edition.  Excerpt. © Reprinted by permission. All rights reserved. Introduction In the wee hours of the morning of August 1  2008  some thirty climbers from ten different expeditions set out from their high camps on the Abruzzi Ridge of K2. At 28 251 feet the world's second- tallest mountain  K2  thrusts skyward out of the Karakoram Range of northern Pakistan. After weeks of sitting out bad weather  the mountaineers were poised to go for the summit on a clear and windless day. During the endless storms  morale at base camp had reached rock bottom  and some climbers had thrown in the towel and gone home. But now everybody still on the mountain was jazzed. As they emerged from their cramped tents to clip on crampons and hoist packs  the climbers were riding a manic high. Sometime that day  they thought  they would claim one of the most elusive and glorious prizes in mountaineering. For most of these men and women  K2 was the goal of a lifetime. Chapter 1: T H E M OT I VATORAlthough the various teams were operating independently  they had tried to cobble together a common logistical plan that would help everyone get to the top. The crucial feature of that plan was the fixing of thin nylon ropes— to be used on the way up  in effect  as handrails  and on the way down as lines that could be easily rappelled. Those fixed ropes were intended to ensure the climbers' passage through the Bottleneck  a steep and dangerous couloir of snow and ice that rises from an altitude of 26 400 feet. The Bottleneck and the sketchy leftward traverse at the top of it form the ""crux"" of the Abruzzi Ridge. Although climbing the Bottleneck is only moderately difficult  what makes that high gauntlet so nerve- racking is a gigantic serac— a cliff of solid ice— that looms above it. Weighing many tons  poised at a vertical and  in places  an overhanging angle  the serac looks as though it is barely attached to the mountain. Yet in the sixtynine years since mountaineers first came to grips with this formidable obstacle  the serac had proved remarkably stable. It seemed  indeed  to be a permanent feature of K2's summit pyramid. Thirty climbers crawling up the same route on the same day would have been business as usual on Mount Everest. On K2—a far more serious mountain  and one that has seen far fewer attempts— such a crowd was unprecedented. Still  as they approached the Bottleneck  thanks to the perfect weather for which they had waited so long  the climbers were awash in optimism. The summit was within their grasp. And then things started to go subtly wrong. Small mistakes were made. Miscommunications  fueled by the many different languages the climbers spoke  flared into angry words. The slower climbers began to block the way for those who were capable of moving faster. Yet the single event that turned an awkward day into a catastrophe was nobody's fault. Within the next thirty- six hours  eleven of those mountaineers would die high on the Abruzzi Ridge. The disaster that unfolded on August 1 would end up as the worst single- event tragedy in the mountain's history  and the second worst in the long chronicle of mountaineering in the Himalaya and the Karakoram. And nobody saw it coming. ------------- Almost sixteen years earlier  on August 16  1992  with my partners Scott Fischer and Charley Mace  I had left our high camp in the predawn darkness and started trudging up toward the Bottleneck. On that day  I  too  had been full of bursting hope  tempered by the wary alertness that is the obligatory state of mind for any alpinist who wants to stay alive in the great ranges. I had previously climbed Everest and Kangchenjunga  the first- and third- highest peaks in the world  but I knew that K2 was in another league of difficulty and danger. Like 2008's climbers  Scott  Charley  and I had had to bide our time for interminable weeks before we finally got a crack at the summit. Not only storms but all kinds of logistical snafus and interpersonal conflicts had delayed our final assault again and again. It was not until fifty- seven days after arriving at base camp that we finally set out for the top. On the other hand  on that August day in 1992  the three of us had had the Bottleneck to ourselves. And fixing ropes up the couloir was not part of our plan. In No Shortcuts to the Top  the memoir I wrote about climbing the world's fourteen highest peaks  I devoted a full chapter to my K2 expedition. Even after K2  it took me several years before I began to consider that it might be possible for me to reach the summit of all fourteen 8 000- meter peaks. For one thing  I didn't think there was any way that I could ever afford to go on so many expeditions. For another  climbing all fourteen 8 000ers seemed far too ambitious a goal. The first person to accomplish that feat had been the great Tyrolean mountaineer Reinhold Messner  who knocked off his fourteenth in 1986. And Messner was like a god to me. Yet with K2  I became the first American to climb the world's three highest mountains. The outdoor magazines ran a few short profiles about me. One of them was titled ""Ed Who?"" Even after those pieces appeared  I was still relatively unknown to the general public  but with the boost in confidence they gave me  I finally got up the nerve to start approaching potential sponsors. K2 was a huge turning point in my life. Yes  it brought me my first modest taste of what you might call ""mountaineering celebrity."" But far more important than any faint whiff of fame were the lessons K2 taught me.  In the aftermath of 2008's disaster  all kinds of armchair ""experts"" delivered their scathing critiques. Nonclimbers clogging the online chat rooms  in response to sensational newspaper articles  took a macabre delight in the tragedy. This was Everest 1996 all over again  they seemed to think— the melodrama of clueless dilettantes who had no business on the mountain buying their way into a catastrophe at the cost of their own lives  as well as the lives of professional guides entrusted with caring for them. (Hundreds of readers of Jon Krakauer's bestseller Into Thin Air reduced his complicated narrative to that simplistic morality play.) After the August 2008 tragedy  Messner himself sounded off in this vein  decrying the ""K2 package deals"" that he assumed had lured novices to the mountain and concluding  ""Something like this is just pure stupidity."" Messner was not the only famous mountaineer to criticize the victims of the 2008 disaster. The temptation to second- guess those luckless climbers' decisions was all but irresistible. Newspapers  magazines  and radio and TV shows called me for my commentary. I was already beginning to think that what had happened on K2 on August 1 was far more complicated than the first tabloid and Internet versions of the story. It would take several weeks for more detailed accounts to trickle down from the slopes of the mountain and find their way to responsible media outlets. And I was not about to cast facile aspersions on climbers who had died on the mountain  or had barely survived it. In 1992  K2 had not only proved to be a turning point in my life— it had been the scene of what I still regard as the greatest mistake I ever made as a mountaineer. The most important lesson I learned from that beautiful and dangerous peak was a blunt one: Don't ever do that again if you want to stay alive. Listen to your instincts  and follow them. Recently  I reread my diary from the K2 trip. I was struck by how different it seemed from the account I had written in No Shortcuts. Events and relationships that seemed really important when they were happening barely made it into the chapter I wrote thirteen years after the expedition. Conversely  some of the most dramatic turning points of my weeks on K2 got covered in my diary in only a few deadpan sentences. I wasn't writing the diary  of course  for anybody else to read. At the time  I thought I was simply making a day- by- day record of the most ambitious mountaineering attempt of my life up to that point. Now I wonder. Any ""story"" can be told in dozens of different ways. For that very reason  I believe  every time you go back and reexamine an important chapter in your life  you learn something new about it. And the reactions of audiences when I give slide shows  as well as the e- mails I received from folks who read No Shortcuts to the Top  gave me many new insights into my own experience. I have always believed that climbing mountains teaches you lessons. And more than that  I firmly believe that those lessons can be applied to the rest of your life. It's not an easy process  however. Mountaineering literature is full of trite clichés about ""conquering an enemy"" or ""transcending your limits."" For at least two centuries  philosophers of the outdoors have insisted that nature is ""a school of character."" Would that it were all so simple! The most important lesson I learned from K2 was that by simply putting off making a decision  I made the worst decision of my life: to climb on into a gathering storm. I was lucky to survive our summit push on K2. Scott and Charley didn't agree with me about this. That day  they never seemed to suffer from the nagging doubts— the knot in my gut  as I've always thought of it— I carried with me hour after hour. Yet my partners' comparatively blithe attitude about our climbing on that August 16 doesn't even begin to tempt me to revise my judgment. It's ultimately a personal thing. K2 is often called the hardest mountain in the world. It's also often called the deadliest. This may not be strictly true: in terms of the ratio of climbers who get to the top compared to those who die on the mountain  Annapurna is more deadly than K2. (I succeeded on Annapurna  in fact  only on my third try  in 2005  and only after I'd begun to wonder whether it was too dangerous a peak to justify another attempt. It became my n..."

"The Stranger ALBERT CAMUS (Vintage International) Amazon.com Review The Stranger is not merely one of the most widely read novels of the 20th century  but one of the books likely to outlive it. Written in 1946  Camus's compelling and troubling tale of a disaffected  apparently amoral young man has earned a durable popularity (and remains a staple of U.S. high school literature courses) in part because it reveals so vividly the anxieties of its time. Alienation  the fear of anonymity  spiritual doubt--all could have been given a purely modern inflection in the hands of a lesser talent than Camus  who won the Nobel Prize in 1957 and was noted for his existentialist aesthetic. The remarkable trick of The Stranger  however  is that it's not mired in period philosophy. The plot is simple. A young Algerian  Meursault  afflicted with a sort of aimless inertia  becomes embroiled in the petty intrigues of a local pimp and  somewhat inexplicably  ends up killing a man. Once he's imprisoned and eventually brought to trial  his crime  it becomes apparent  is not so much the arguably defensible murder he has committed as it is his deficient character. The trial's proceedings are absurd  a parsing of incidental trivialities--that Meursault  for instance  seemed unmoved by his own mother's death and then attended a comic movie the evening after her funeral are two ostensibly damning facts--so that the eventual sentence the jury issues is both ridiculous and inevitable. Meursault remains a cipher nearly to the story's end--dispassionate  clinical  disengaged from his own emotions. ""She wanted to know if I loved her "" he says of his girlfriend. ""I answered the same way I had the last time  that it didn't mean anything but that I probably didn't."" There's a latent ominousness in such observations  a sense that devotion is nothing more than self-delusion. It's undoubtedly true that Meursault exhibits an extreme of resignation  however  his confrontation with ""the gentle indifference of the world"" remains as compelling as it was when Camus first recounted it. --Ben Guterson  Review “The Stranger is a strikingly modern text and Matthew Ward’s translation will enable readers to appreciate why Camus’s stoical anti-hero and ­devious narrator remains one of the key expressions of a postwar Western malaise  and one of the cleverest exponents of a literature of ambiguity.” –from the Introduction by Peter Dunwoodie 				    	 					              See all Product description"

All rights reserved. the foundations of the art      chapter one          We live in an age of information. The media are able to broadcast global events within seconds of their occurrence. The Internet links us to specialized data. Increasingly  we hope that scientific and technological advances will grant us a better understanding of ourselves  along with the secrets of well-being.   Our growing reliance upon external information has gradually obscured a simple  innate awareness that all of us have long possessed. Inherent in this awareness are all the tools that we need to genuinely enrich our health and the quality of our lives.     A student seeking to familiarize herself with the Art of Jin Shin Jyutsu attended her first class.   During the lunch break  the student introduced herself to the teacher  Mary Burmeister. She confessed to feeling a bit overwhelmed. “I’m afraid that I don’t know anything about Jin Shin Jyutsu.”   Mary smiled and said  “You already know everything about it.”   The art of Jin Shin Jyutsu enables us to re-experience this awareness. Moreover  it teaches us how to utilize it for greater physical  mental  and spiritual well-being. No complicated technique or effort is required to apply it. Its seeds have lain dormant within us for virtually thousands of years. In order to revive them  we need only heed Plato’s teaching that “learning is remembering.”   the life in all things   In ancient times traditional people saw no distinction between body  mind  and spirit. Consequently  the practices they used to assist the body naturally promoted physical  emotional  and spiritual wholeness. Moreover  people saw their health or “harmony” as dependent upon bringing seemingly disparate elements into balance.   Jin Shin Jyutsu (pronounced jin shin jitsu) helps us remember that every one of us possesses the simplest instruments needed to bring about harmonious balance—the breath and hands. It reminds us that these instruments are all that we need to enhance our physical and mental vitality  which in turn help eliminate the causes underlying disease  or “disharmony.” Most importantly  it reawakens our awareness of the life energy that permeates the universe. This renewed awareness enables us to send life-giving energy through various locations on the body.   The concept of a life energy that pervades the universe and gives life to all things is unfamiliar to many of us. In much of the Western world  we’re likely to view life as nothing more than certain chemical processes that make possible the utilization of energy  metabolism  growth  and reproduction.   This concept  given to us by modern science  focuses on the biological aspects of life. From its point of view  life begins and ends with biology  or with the physical part of life. But practitioners of Jin Shin Jyutsu—and indeed  traditional people everywhere—ask themselves: What powers these chemical interactions? What gives life to our organs and systems? What is the force that brings the body to life?   In seeking the answers to these questions  traditional people learned to look beyond to the underlying energy that vitalizes the physical body. They see life as pervaded by a single living force  manifested in every individual organism—plants  insects  animals  and human beings. The ancient Greeks referred to this energy as pneuma  the Hindus call it prana  the Chinese know it as chi (also qi)  and the Japanese  ki.   The recognition of a life energy that animates all living things is not merely a philosophical belief. It is also a practical approach to life and healing. Indeed  virtually all traditional healing systems—from Ayurvedic to Greek and Chinese—are founded on the principle that in order to heal the body  the person must strengthen and harmonize the flow of life energy within. This principle provides the basis for such arts as acupuncture and acupressure  as well as for the healing herbs and foods of Chinese medicine.   Mary Burmeister  who introduced Jin Shin Jyutsu to the Western world more than forty years ago  illustrates the importance of life energy by using a simple analogy: “What makes a car engine start when you turn on the key? The battery of the car. The battery is the necessary energy source for the various functions of the car. Now  what makes a heart beat? What makes breathing possible? What makes digestion possible? The Battery of Life. An energy source is necessary for the body to function. That source is the battery of life.”   Our health or harmony depends upon the free and even distribution of this life energy throughout our body  mind  and spirit. When the stress and strain of daily living disrupts the movement of life energy  our mind  body  and spirit are all affected. Not only do we succumb to worry  fear  anger  sadness  and pretensions  but we increase our tendency to become ill or “out of balance.”   Quite simply  Jin Shin Jyutsu is a way to balance the life energy. It shows us how to use simple hands-on sequences to restore emotional equilibrium  relieve pain  and release the causes of both acute and chronic conditions. It can be used safely in conjunction with any other therapy or medication. Furthermore  its benefits are cumulative  so that the more we practice it  the greater is our vitality and self-knowledge.   Jin Shin Jyutsu can be used anywhere and at any time. Its methods are so easy and unobtrusive that you may use them on yourself in a crowded bus or in the middle of a difficult meeting. The only thing people may notice—if they notice anything at all—is a more balanced demeanor  an aura of relaxation  and—upon closer examination—that you are holding one or more of your fingers.   the forgotten art  recently remembered   The name Jin Shin Jyutsu means “The Art of the Creator through the person of compassion.” The healing art that those words represent is based upon our own natural  innate ability to harmonize ourselves. For thousands of years  ancient peoples used this awareness to heal both themselves and others. But with successive generations this awareness grew dimmer until it was all but forgotten. In the early part of the twentieth century  a Japanese sage named Jiro Murai recovered Jin Shin Jyutsu—out of necessity.   Jiro Murai was born in Taiseimura (currently Kaga City)  in Ishikawa Prefecture  in 1886. He was the second son born to his parents. Jiro’s father  like his father and so many of his ancestors  was a medical doctor. Since Japanese custom expected that the eldest son would follow in the profession of his father  Jiro was free to choose his own path. He started out as a breeder of silkworms  but he had a reckless nature and overindulged in food and drink—even to the point of entering eating contests  in which he was awarded cash prizes for consuming huge quantities. By the time he was 26  he was seriously ill. A succession of doctors treated him  but his condition only worsened until he was pronounced incurable and given up for terminally ill. As a last request  he asked his family to carry him on a stretcher to their mountain cabin and to leave him there alone for seven days. He asked that they return for him on the eighth day.   There in the cabin Murai fasted  meditated  and practiced various finger postures. During this time he passed in and out of consciousness. His physical body grew colder. But on the seventh day he felt as if he had been lifted out of a deep freeze and thrown into a blazing furnace. When the intense heat subsided  he experienced a tremendous calm and inner peace. To his great surprise  he was healed. He dropped to his knees  gave thanks  and pledged his life to the study of healing.   Murai’s commitment to understanding the causes of disharmony was profound. Gil Burmeister remembers him as a man obsessed with the pursuit of knowledge: “Jiro did his research among the homeless in Wano Park  in Tokyo. A large population lived in the park. Jiro would take care of the people there and study the incredible variety of illnesses that these people presented. I remember that he went through a period of studying ear problems for a while. He wanted to work on anybody who had any kind of ear complaint. Once he understood ear problems  he’d go on to something else.” Murai’s prodigious research led him to an awareness of a healing art that he called Jin Shin Jyutsu.   As Murai’s understanding of the Art deepened  the meaning of the name Jin Shin Jyutsu evolved. At first  he used the words to mean “the Art of Happiness ” later “the Art of Longevity.” The meaning further evolved to “the Art of Benevolence” and ultimately to “the Art of the Creator through the person of compassion.”"

घटना-समय पद्धति (ETP - Event Time Prediction) This book घटना-समय पद्धति or Event Time Prediction (ETP) presents one of the most powerful technique for answering questions with the direct help of mother nature. This technique existed in ancient India since ages and was used by rishis  to resolve the problems of people who approached them for relief from their grief. This technique disappeared amongst the group of learned scholars for some thousand years and was available to only a select few  it has been passed onto the next generation directly by the Guru-Shishya tradition. Sh. A. B. Shukla  Hon. National President of ICAS (Indian Council of Astrological Sciences)  has re-discovered this vanished ancient technique of rishi's in the modern parlance. He has developed his own innovative method of prediction on top of the fundamentals laid down by the ancient scriptures  thus making it applicable in our present technological world. This book is an attempt to spread this divine science back amongst all the knowledge seekers of Jyotisha. The fundamental principals of घटना-समय पद्धति or Event Time Prediction are based on Vedas  Upanishads and Bhagavad Geeta and is one of the spiritual branches of Jyotisha  which also includes the Shakun Shastra. Technically speaking Jyotisha is not just Astrology  but it is beyond it  although Astrology is taken as the english translation of Jyotisha but that is not correct. Astrology is more based on astronomical calculations and placement combinatorial analysis of planets. Jyotisha is a Vedang (limb of Veda) it also involves understanding of the deeper spiritual aspects of life along with predictions. So is the purpose of ETP  to take the learner on a spiritual elevation journey along with learning how to answer a question for prediction. This book will benefit horary astrologers also along with general spiritual readers.

"Quantum Healing: Exploring the Frontiers of Mind Body Medicine Amazon.com Review Early on in Quantum Healing  Deepak Chopra asks an interesting question: Why  when your body mends a broken arm  is it not considered a miracle  but when your body rids itself of cancer  it is? Chopra believes the two phenomena spring from the same well  that the body is capable of doing much more than we assume it can. He calls this ability to cure disease from within ""quantum healing "" and shows how we're all capable of it. He believes intelligence exists everywhere in our bodies  in each of our 50 trillion cells  and that therefore each cell knows how to heal itself. It's a fascinating assertion  one that remains unprovable by science but overwhelmingly true by anecdote. 				    	 					 From the Inside Flap Here is an extraordinary new approach to healing by an extraordinary physician-writer -- a book filled with the mystery  wonder  and hope of people who have experienced seemingly miraculous recoveries from cancer and other serious illnesses.Dr. Deepak Chopra  a respected New England endocrinologist  began his search for answers when he saw patients in his own practice who completely recovered after being given only a few months to live. In the mid-1980's he returned to his native India to explore Aruyveda  humanities most ancient healing tradition. Now he has brought together the current research of Wetern medicine  neuoscience  and physics with the insights of Ayurvedic theory to show that the human body is controlled by a ""network of intelligence"" grounded in quantum reality. Not a superficial psychological state  this intelligence lies deep enough to change the basic pattenrs that design our physiology -- with the potential to defeat cancer  heart disease  and even aging itself. in this inspiring and pioneering work  Dr. Chopra offers us both a fascinating intellectual journey and a deeply moving chronicle of hope and healing."

"Watercolour Landscapes Step-by-Step (Painting Step-by-Step) Review July 14 This new compilation offers a comprehensive guide to painting landscapes in watercolour  showing the results achievable with very different painting styles. There is information on materials  colour mixing  techniques - including spattering and dry brush  sketching  composition  perspective and tone. Eleven step-by-step demonstrations put all this information into practice. * Leisure Painter  The * Apr 14 This is another of Search Press's bind-ups of previous material and I'm still not sure whether I've reviewed it before or not - or maybe in a slightly different guise. They've got very good at this latterly and  rather than obvious joins where one book ends and another begins  the whole thing is now seamless. The material may not be new  but it's still sound and the reproduction is as fresh as it ever was  so this isn't resurrecting a corpse but bringing excellent material to a potential new audience at a very affordable price. As well as some technical pieces on things like perspective and composition  demonstrations from popular authors cover trees  water  snow  buildings and so on (and on). If you have other books by these authors  you'd need to check for duplication but  equally  there's so much here  you probably won't be getting too much cross-over. If you only have a small library and are on a budget into the bargain  you could do a great deal worse than invest in this. * Artbookreview.net * 				    	 					 About the Author Geoff Kersey is an experienced watercolourist and is much in demand as a teacher and demonstrator.

It would be a good choice for a reading group.""

With its coherent viewpoint  accurate and extensive coverage  and generally good explanations  Bishop's book is a useful introduction ... and a valuable reference for the principle techniques used in these fields."" (Radford M. Neal  Technometrics  Vol. 49 (3)  August  2007) ""This book appears in the Information Science and Statistics Series commissioned by the publishers. ...

(H. Van Dyke Parunak  ACM Computing Reviews  Vol. 49 (3)  March  2008) 				    	 					 From the Back Cover The dramatic growth in practical applications for machine learning over the last ten years has been accompanied by many important developments in the underlying algorithms and techniques. For example  Bayesian methods have grown from a specialist niche to become mainstream  while graphical models have emerged as a general framework for describing and applying probabilistic techniques. The practical applicability of Bayesian methods has been greatly enhanced by the development of a range of approximate inference algorithms such as variational Bayes and expectation propagation  while new models based on kernels have had a significant impact on both algorithms and applications. This completely new textbook reflects these recent developments while providing a comprehensive introduction to the fields of pattern recognition and machine learning. It is aimed at advanced undergraduates or first-year PhD students  as well as researchers and practitioners. No previous knowledge of pattern recognition or machine learning concepts is assumed. Familiarity with multivariate calculus and basic linear algebra is required  and some experience in the use of probabilities would be helpful though not essential as the book includes a self-contained introduction to basic probability theory. The book is suitable for courses on machine learning  statistics  computer science  signal processing  computer vision  data mining  and bioinformatics. Extensive support is provided for course instructors  including more than 400 exercises  graded according to difficulty. Example solutions for a subset of the exercises are available from the book web site  while solutions for the remainder can be obtained by instructors from the publisher. The book is supported by a great deal of additional material  and the reader is encouraged to visit the book web site for the latest information. Christopher M. Bishop is Deputy Director of Microsoft Research Cambridge  and holds a Chair in Computer Science at the University of Edinburgh. He is a Fellow of Darwin College Cambridge  a Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering  and a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.

"God  Sex  and Gender: An Introduction Review Many of the critiques of God  Sex  and Genderoffered in this review emerge from Thatcher s own lines of interrogation. In this and other ways  the book succeeds in drawing readers into what is truly an exhilarating mode of reflection. As such  it offers a major contribution towards theological depth and creativity in this important set of discourses  renewing the often reflexive ethics of sex and gender through witness to the Word become flesh. (Studies in Christian Ethics  16 April 2014) Written as a text for post-secondary courses  this book aims to provide a comprehensive and consistent theological understanding of sexuality and gender  which is broad  contemporary  undogmatic  questioning  inclusive  and relevant to readers interests  needs  and experience (xi). (Studies in Religion  1 September 2013) ""Adrian Thatcher's new book will be a rich resource for those studying and teaching sex  gender and sexuality in theological perspective ... The volume is a valuable one  which I hope will prompt readers to go and explore Thatcher's own extensive work form the past  as well as the broader context of theological scholarship on sexuality  gender and marriage within which it sits."" (Theology  1 January 2012) ""Although designed as an introduction for theology students  this is a really remarkable book covering a whole range of sensitive subjects in a deeply humane fashion."" (Network Review  1 June 2011) 				    	 					 From the Back Cover The last 50 years have seen unprecedented changes in sexual and gender relationships. These include the easy availability of contraception  the separation of sexual experience from marriage and marriage from parenthood  more broken marriages  and legal provision for same-sex unions. Relationships between men and women have changed from a model of male dominance  towards a new model of male/female equality  and on to a new recognition of sexual and gender difference. These transformations have resulted in great benefits but they have also generated great uncertainties and unfulfilled expectations. They have sparked painful and on-going controversies in all the churches. God  Sex  and Gender is a clear and engaging introduction to these issues. It offers a consistent theological understanding which is contemporary  undogmatic  questioning  and relevant to readers' experience  interests and needs.Throughout the book  Thatcher connects theological ideas  with broader  secular thought. It fills a gap in the literature by linking together the diverse themes of sexuality  gender and Christian thought in one coherent volume. Its comprehensive and even-handed discussion of these issues will ensure it becomes a vital text in the field. 				    	 					              See all Product description"

I can well understand why it has had such a splendid acceptance.”—Norman Vincent Peale   “At last! A book on sales and salesmanship that can be read and enjoyed by veteran and recruit alike! I have just completed The Greatest Salesman in the World for the second time—it was too good for just one reading—and in all sincerity  I say that it is the most readable  most constructive and most useful instrument for the teaching of sales as a profession that I have ever read.”—F.W. Errigo  Manager  U. S. Sales Trainer at Parke  Davis & Company   “I have read almost every book that has ever been written on salesmanship  but I think Og Mandino has captured all of them in The Greatest Salesman in the World. No one who follows these principles will ever fail as a salesman  and no one will ever be truly great without them  but  the author has done more than present the principles—he has woven them into the fabric of one of the most fascinating stories I have ever read.”—Paul J. Meyer  President of Success Motivation Institute  Inc.   “Every sales manager should read The Greatest Salesman in the World. It is a book to keep at the bedside  or on the living room table—a book to dip into as needed  to browse in now and then  to enjoy in small stimulating portions. It is a book for the hours and for the years  a book to turn to over and over again  as to a friend  a book of moral  spiritual and ethical guidance  an unfailing source of comfort and inspiration.”—Lester J. Bradshaw  Jr.  Former Dean  Dale Carnegie Institute of Effective Speaking & Human Relations   “I was overwhelmed by The Greatest Salesman in the World. It is  without doubt  the greatest and the most touching story I have ever read. It is so good that there are two musts that I would attach to it: First  you must not lay it down until you have finished it  and secondly  every individual who sells anything  and that includes us all  must read it.”—Robert B. Hensley  President  Life Insurance Co. of Kentucky   “Og Mandino provocatively prods your attention into fascination as he masterfully relates his story. The Greatest Salesman in the World is a book with emotional appeal for millions.”—Roy Garn  Executive Director  Emotional Appeal Institute    “There are very few men who have the writing talent with which Og Mandino has been blessed. The thoughts contained in this book symbolize the importance of selling to the entire world’s existence.”—Sol Polk  President  Polk Bros.  Inc.   “I have just finished the uninterrupted reading of The Greatest Salesman in the World. The plot is original and ingenious. The style is interesting and fascinating. The message is moving and inspiring. Everyone of us is a salesman  no matter what his occupation or profession. Most of all  first he must sell himself to himself in order to find personal happiness and peace of mind. This book  if carefully read  absorbed and heeded  can help every one of us to be his best salesman.”—Dr. Louis Binstock  Rabbi  Temple Sholom  Chicago   “I like the story . . . I like the style . . . I like the book. Every salesman and members of his family should read it.”—W. Clement Stone  President  Combined Insurance Co. of America   “In my opinion  The Greatest Salesman in the World by Og Mandino will become a classic.

Success Through a Positive Mental Attitude About the Author Napoleon Hill  born in Pound  Southwest Virginia in 1883  was a very successful American author in the area of the new thought movement—one of the earliest producers of the modern genre of personal-success literature. He is widely considered to be one of the great writers on success. Hill had to drop out of college because of lack of funds to support his education. The turning point in his life occurred in 1908 when he interviewed the industrialist Andrew Carnegie  the most powerful men in the world at that time  as a part of an assignment. As a result of Hill’s studies via Carnegie’s introductions  the Philosophy of Achievement was offered as a formula for rags-to-riches success by Hill and Carnegie. It was published initially in 1928 as the multi-volume study course The Law of Success in Sixteen Lessons. He later produced his most famous work  Think and Grow Rich  which is one of the bestselling books of all time. Hill  who had even served as the advisor to President Franklin D. Roosevelt from 1933-36  passed away at the age of 87.

"Zen Golf: Mastering the Mental Game From the Publisher A senior writer for Golf Digest described ZEN GOLF: Mastering the Mental Game as ""Soothing and enlightening  entertaining and provocative  here is a book that is highly original  exciting  and deserves notice."" In May 2002  ZEN GOLF was released in hardcover. By December it went to its fifth printing  charted as the current bestselling instructional golf book in America. In response to many requests for an audio version (especially for listening to while driving to the golf course)  the audiobook has been produced as an unabridged edition  a 4 CD set in an attractive jewel case  read by the author  PGA TOUR Instructor Dr. Joseph Parent. It conveys through the author's own expressions the wisdom so many golfers of all levels have found in ZEN GOLF. Fred Shoemaker  author of Extraordinary Golf  wrote  ""Dr. Parent has beautifully melded the timeless wisdom of Buddhism with his timely insights as a golf coach. Here is a roadmap to inner confidence  self-awareness and the feel of a purely struck golf shot. We are approaching a turning point in the way golf or anything else is learned. This approach to learning and life is a wonderfuland perhaps our most powerfulhope for the future."" 				    	 					 About the Author Regarded as ""the Phil Jackson of the Fairways "" Dr. Joseph Parent has blended professional golf instruction with Buddhist philosophy and modern psychology. He has taught mindful awareness practice and stress management for more than 25 years. However  it is the application of both disciplines to the ancient and challenging game of golf that distinguishes him as a top PGA TOUR Instructor  attracting such clients as Masters and PGA Champion Vijay Singh. From the start  a basic principle of his instruction has been: ""People say  If only Id play better  Id enjoy it more. It actually works the other way around. If youd enjoy it more  youd play better."" He has developed ways to apply mindful awareness as a path to success in the mental game of golf and other sports  as well as in business and life. In the last twelve years Dr. Parent has worked with dozens of professional golfers  as well as hundreds of amateur golfers and other athletes at all levels: from beginners to club champions  from age 7 to 82. Dr. Parent is a speaker at corporate conferences and outings  as well as staff training sessions and client-centered programs  for companies such as Merrill Lynch  the Tiger Woods Foundation  Bank of America  Fidelity Investments  the PGA of America  Asanti  Aliant Telecom  and others. In the last few years  Dr. Parent has been featured in television appearances on CNNs Headline News  NBCs Today in New York  and The Golf Channels Roundtable and Viewers Forum. ZEN GOLF's central theme reflects the Buddhist vision of enlightened society  built on the cornerstones of four principles: virtue  discipline  humor and friendship. Says Dr. Parent  ""When body and mind are synchronized in the present moment  we can uncover our inherent dignity and confidence. The ultimate goal is not just to help people become better golfers  but better human beings  ones who can relate to themselves and others in a genuine  kind  and courageous way.""

"One-straw Revolution: Introduction to Natural Farming Review The One-Straw Revolution is one of the founding documents of the alternative food movement  and indispensable to anyone hoping to understand the future of food and agriculture. Michael Pollan Fukuoka's do-nothing approach to farming is not only revolutionary in terms of growing food  but it is also applicable to other aspects of living  (creativity  child-rearing  activism  career  etc.) His holistic message is needed now more than ever as we search for new ways of approaching the environment  our community and life. It is time for us all to join his 'non-movement. Keri Smith author of How to be an Explorer of the World Japan s most celebrated alternative farmer...Fukuoka s vision offers a beacon  a goal  an ideal to strive for. Tom Philpott  The One-Straw Revolution shows the critical role of locally based agroecological knowledge in developing sustainable farming systems. Sustainable Architecture With no ploughing  weeding  fertilizers  external compost  pruning or chemicals  his minimalist approach reduces labour time to a fifth of more conventional practices. Yet his success in yields is comparable to more resource-intensive methods...The method is now being widely adopted to vegetate arid areas. His books  such as The One-Straw Revolution have been inspirational to cultivators the world over. New Internationalist. --New Internationalist 				    	 					 About the Author Masanobu Fukuoka (1913 2008) was born and raised on the Japanese island of Shikoku. He was the oldest son of a rice farmer who was also the local mayor. Fukuoka studied plant pathology and worked for number of years as a produce inspector in the customs office in Yokohama. But in 1938 he returned to his village home determined to put his ideas about natural farming into practice. During World War II  he worked for the Japanese government as a researcher on food production  managing to avoid military service until the final few months of the war. After the war  he returned to Shikoku to devote himself wholeheartedly to farming. And in 1975  distressed by the effects of Japan s post-war modernization  Fukuoka wrote The One-Straw Revolution. In his later years  Fukuoka was involved with several projects to reduce desertification throughout the world. He remained an active farmer until well into his eighties  and continued to give lectures until only a few years before his death at the age of ninety-five. Fukuoka is also the author of The Natural Way of Farming and The Road Back to Nature. In 1988 he received the Magsaysay Award for Public Service.Frances Moore Lappé is author or co-author of sixteen books  including Diet for a Small Planet and Getting a Grip: Clarity  Creativity  and Courage in a World Gone Mad.

"Waking Up: A Guide to Spirituality Without Religion Review “Harris’s book . . . caught my eye because it’s so entirely of this moment  so keenly in touch with the growing number of Americans who are willing to say that they do not find the succor they crave  or a truth that makes sense to them  in organized religion.” (Frank Bruni  columnist  New York Times)“The fact is that Waking Up lends a different picture of Harris (at least to me): an intelligent and sensitive person who is willing to undergo the discomfort involved in proposing alternatives to the religions he’s spent years degrading. His new book  whether discussing the poverty of spiritual language  the neurophysiology of consciousness  psychedelic experience  or the quandaries of the self  at the very least acknowledges the potency and importance of the religious impulse—though Harris might name it differently—that fundamental and common instinct to seek not just an answer to life  but a way to live that answer.” (Trevor Quirk  The New Republic)""[A]n extraordinary and ambitious masterwork. . . . altogether spectacular."" (Maria Popova  Brainpickings)“Uber-atheist Sam Harris is getting all spiritual. In his new book  Waking Up: A Guide to Spirituality Without Religion  the usually outspoken critic of religion describes how spirituality can and must be divorced from religion if the human mind is to reach its full potential. . . . But there is plenty in Waking Up that will delight Harris’ most militant atheist readers.” (Religion News Service) “The great value and novelty of this book is that Harris  in a simple but rigorous style  takes the middle way between these pseudoscientific and pseudo-spiritual assertions . . . [leading] to a profoundly more salubrious life.” (Publishers Weekly)""A demanding  illusion-shattering book.” (Kirkus Reviews)“Don’t read Waking Up . . . if you want to be told that heaven is real. Do read it if you want to explore the nature of consciousness  to learn how just trying to be mindful can free you from anxiety and self-blame.” (MORE Magazine)“Waking Up is an eye opening  mind expanding book.” (AA Agnostica)“A seeker’s memoir  a scientific and philosophical exploration of the self  and a how-to guide for transcendence  Waking Up explores the nature of consciousness  explains how to meditate  tells you the best drugs to take  and warns you about lecherous gurus. It will shake up your most fundamental beliefs about everyday experience  and it just might change your life.” (Paul Bloom  Professor of Psychology and Cognitive Science  Yale University and author of ""Just Babies: The Origins of Good and Evil"")“Waking Up is a rigorous  kind  clear  and witty book that will point you toward the selflessness that is our original nature.” (Stephen Mitchell)“Sam Harris points out the rational methodology for exploring the nature of consciousness and for experiencing a transformative understanding of possibilities. Waking Up really does help us wake up.” (Joseph Goldstein  author of ""Mindfulness: A Practical Guide to Awakening"" and ""One Dharma"")“As a neuroscientist  Sam Harris shows how our egos are illusions  diffuse products of brain activity  and as a long-term practitioner of meditation  he shows how abandoning this illusion can wake us up to a richer life  more connected to everything around us.” (Jerry Coyne  Professor of Biology at the University of Chicago and author of ""Why Evolution is True"")""Sam Harris ranks as my favorite skeptic  bar none. In Waking Up he gives us a clear-headed  no-holds-barred look at the spiritual supermarket  calling out what amounts to junk food and showing us where real nutrition can be found. Anyone who realizes the value of a spiritual life will find much to savor here – and those who see no value in it will find much to reflect on."" (Daniel Goleman  author Emotional Intelligence and Focus)""Sam Harris has written a beautifully rational book about spiritually  consciousness and transcendence. He is the high priest of spirituality without religion. I recommend this book regardless of your belief system. As befits a book called Waking Up  it’s an eye opener."" (A.J. Jacobs  bestselling author of The Year of Living Biblically)Praise for Free Will:  Publishers Weekly Top 10 Science Book of Spring 2012   “A nimble book  amiably and conversationally jumping from point to point. The book’s length is one of its charms: He never belabors any one topic or idea  sticking around exactly as long as he needs to in order to lay out his argument (and tackle the rebuttals that it will inevitably provoke) and not a page longer.” —Washington Post   “A brief and forceful broadside at the conundrum that has nagged at every major thinker from Plato to Slavoj Zizek. Self-avowedly secular  [Harris is] addressing the need for individual growth and social betterment  and [is] doing so with compelling argument and style.” —Los Angeles Times   “Harris skewers the concept of free will — that mainstay of law  policy and politics — in fewer than 100 pages.” —Nature   ""Brilliant and witty—and never less than incisive—Free Will shows that Sam Harris can say more in 13 000 words than most people do in 100 000."" —Oliver SacksPraise for The Moral Landscape:   “The most compelling strand in “The Moral Landscape” is its unspooling diatribe against relativism.” —New York Times   “This is an inspiring book  holding out as it does the possibility of a rational understanding of how to construct the good life with the aid of science  free from the accretions of religious superstition and cultural coercion.” —Financial Times  “Harris’s is a first-principle argument  backed by copious empirical evidence woven through a tightly reasoned narrative… Harris’s program of a science-based morality is a courageous one that I wholeheartedly endorse.” —Scientific American   “Sam Harris breathes intellectual fire into an ancient debate. Reading this thrilling  audacious book  you feel the ground shifting beneath your feet. Reason has never had a more passionate advocate.”—Ian McEwan   “I was one of those who had unthinkingly bought into the hectoring myth that science can say nothing about morals. To my surprise  The Moral Landscape has changed all that for me. It should change it for philosophers too. Philosophers of mind have already discovered that they can't duck the study of neuroscience  and the best of them have raised their game as a result.  Sam Harris shows that the same should be true of moral philosophers  and it will turn their world exhilaratingly upside down. As for religion  and the preposterous idea that we need God to be good  nobody wields a sharper bayonet than Sam Harris.”—Richard Dawkins  “Reading Sam Harris is like drinking water from a cool stream on a hot day. He has the rare ability to frame arguments that are not only stimulating  they are downright nourishing… His discussions will provoke secular liberals and religious conservatives alike  who jointly argue from different perspectives that there always will be an unbridgeable chasm between merely knowing what is and discerning what should be. As was the case with Harris’ previous books  readers are bound to come away with previously firm convictions about the world challenged  and a vital new awareness about the nature and value of science and reason in our lives.” —Lawrence M. Krauss  Foundation Professor and Director of the ASU Origins Project at Arizona State University  author of The Physics of Star Trek  and  Quantum Man: Richard Feynman’s Life in Science    “A lively  provocative  and timely new look at one of the deepest problems in the world of ideas. Harris makes a powerful case for a morality that is based on human flourishing and thoroughly enmeshed with science and rationality. It is a tremendously appealing vision  and one that no thinking person can afford to ignore.” —Steven Pinker  Harvard College Professor of Psychology  Harvard University  and author of How the Mind Works and The Blank Slate.“Expanding upon concepts posited in the End of Faith and Free Will  neuroscientist Harris draws from personal contemplative practice and a growing body of scientific research to argue that the self  the feeling that there is an “I” residing in one’s head  is both an illusion and the primary cause of human suffering…. The great value and novelty of this book is that Harris  in a simple but rigorous style  takes the middle way between… pseudoscientific and pseudospiritual assertions  cogently maintaining that while such contemplative insights provide no evidence for metaphysical claims  they are available  and seeing them for ourselves leads to a profoundly more salubrious life.” (Publishers Weekly) 				    	 					 About the Author Sam Harris is the author of the bestselling books The End of Faith  Letter to a Christian Nation  The Moral Landscape  Free Will  and Lying. The End of Faith won the 2005 PEN Award for Nonfiction.

Excerpt. © Reprinted by permission. All rights reserved. INTRODUCTIONWhen I first launched my dream to be a professional photographer back in the early 1970s  I began as most did at that time: by shooting with the less expensive black-and-white films. I had my own darkroom  which meant that I was also processing all of my own black-and-white film and making prints of the best shots. Six months after I exposed my first black-and-white photograph  I walked into the local camera store in Salem  Oregon  and was delighted to find seven rolls of outdated film sitting in a half-price basket on the countertop. I quickly grabbed all seven rolls  paid the salesperson around fourteen dollars  and headed out the door  gleeful at the money I had saved and in anticipation of a camping trip that weekend  when I would surely shoot all seven rolls.After my return on Monday  I was visiting my brother—the one who inspired me to get into photography in the first place—and shared the fun I'd had shooting all seven rolls. I laid them out on his kitchen counter  asking whether I needed to take any extra steps to process the outdated film. He looked at them and quickly said  “You can’t process any of these rolls because they’re not black and white. This is color slide film!” I was stunned. As far as I was concerned  a slideshow was the last thing I wanted to make. I was sure the compositions from the camping trip had been my best work yet  but now they would never be the amazing black-and-white images I had hoped to print. Seeing my crestfallen face  my brother pointed out that it was possible to have prints made from color slides—it was just expensive and time-consuming. The wait could be up to one week and I  at the young age of eighteen  had yet to master the art of patience.Days passed before my frustration subsided enough to return to the camera store with the seven rolls of Agfachrome 50 film. And several days later  I returned to pick up my slides after a long day’s work as a maintenance man for the City of Salem. What happened next was truly a defining moment in my then-young photographic career. As I placed each slide across the camera store’s light table  I was confronted with some truly remarkable color-filled compositions. The fields of wildflowers and the blue sky with white puffy clouds seemed to leap off the light table. A plate of sliced cucumbers and tomatoes (one of my meals on the camping trip) screamed with the vividness of complementary colors. It was transformative  I was awash in the tremendous power of color. Within minutes  I asked the camera-store owner if he had any more outdated film—if he did  I would take every last roll.Unfortunately  he had no more  but he did offer an attractive discount if I would buy ten rolls at once  and an even better one if I would buy twenty (called a “brick” of film). Little did I know just how many bricks I would buy over the next thirty-plus years. My love for color photography had begun.Soon after  I picked up an orange filter at the camera store and started using it to photograph sunsets and sunrises. And later  while fumbling through a cardboard box on the countertop of that same camera store  I discovered a deeply colored magenta filter and a deep blue filter. Although I never found much use for the blue filter  I had no trouble beginning my love affair with the magenta filter. It was remarkably useful when shooting during the predawn and twilight “blue hour ” when the sun is below the horizon and the sky takes on a predominantly blue hue  as well as for shooting cityscapes and landscapes."

"Selfie: How We Became So Self-Obsessed and What It's Doing to Us Review It's easy to look at Instagram and selfie-sticks and shake our heads at millennial narcissism.

The Alchemist From AudioFile Pure joy and enchantment are the best ways to describe Paul Coelho's mystical novel of a Spanish shepherd boy seeking his destiny. In that same spirit narrator Yareli Arizmendi spins this marvelous tale of exotic adventure. The tale ranges from the countryside of Spain to the glittering oasis of the Egyptian desert.

"Artemis: A gripping  high-concept thriller from the bestselling author of The Martian Review ""Artemis does for the moon what The Martian did for Mars. His second novel concerns a likeable protagonist in peril  saved by her own resourcefulness  in a tale that leaves readers better informed about science than they were before they read it...Plus the narrator has real charm. There's no question that this novel is going to be a hit"" (The Guardian)""Jazz  Weir’s main character  is a moon-born version of Stieg Larsson’s Lisbeth Salander. She is young  rebellious and a petty criminal...Weir’s great strength  as he showed in The Martian  is to make us believe. His future society living inside massive domes built not far from where Armstrong set foot in 1969 is utterly plausible."" (The Times)""Weir has done it again: he’s created a diverse and fantastic new world  filled with eclectic and memorable characters  and woven them into a dazzling work of contemporary science fiction – one that’s chock-full of actual science. Artemis is everything you could hope for in a follow-up to his smash debut The Martian: another smart  fun  fast-paced adventure that you won’t be able to put down  featuring a heroine who’s equal parts Ellen Ripley  Arya Stark  and Jyn Erso. I can’t recommend it enough!"" (ERNEST CLINE bestselling author of Ready Player One)""All the things I loved about The Martian are here in spades―the hard science Weir somehow makes accessible and riveting  the masterful  never-see-it-coming plotting  but most of all the voice of his new protagonist  Jazz Bashara―an irreverent  witty  vulnerable heroine  who  just like Mark Watney  is exactly the kind of character you’ll want to spend a book with.

"The Metamorphosis (Bantam Classics) Review “Kafka’s survey of the insectile situation of young Jews in inner Bohemia can hardly be improved upon: ‘With their posterior legs they were still glued to their father’s Jewishness and with their wavering anterior legs they found no new ground.’ There is a sense in which Kafka’s Jewish question (‘What have I in common with Jews?’) has become everybody’s question  Jewish alienation the template for all our doubts. What is Muslimness? What is femaleness? What is Polishness? These days we all find our anterior legs flailing before us. We’re all insects  all Ungeziefer  now.” —Zadie Smith “Kafka engaged in no technical experiments whatsoever  without in any way changing the German language  he stripped it of its involved constructions until it became clear and simple  like everyday speech purified of slang and negligence. The common experience of Kafka’s readers is one of general and vague fascination  even in stories they fail to understand  a precise recollection of strange and seemingly absurd images and descriptions—until one day the hidden meaning reveals itself to them with the sudden evidence of a truth simple and incontestable.” —Hannah Arendt  From the Publisher ""When Gregor Samsa woke up one morning from unsettling dreams  he found himself changed in his bed into a monstrous vermin."" With this startling  bizarre  yet surprisingly funny first sentence  Kafka begins his masterpiece  The Metamorphosis. It is the story of a young man who  transformed overnight into a giant beetlelike insect  becomes an object of disgrace to his family  an outsider in his own home  a quintessentially alienated man. A harrowing -- though absurdly comic -- meditation on human feelings of inadequecy  guilt  and isolation  The Metamorphosis has taken its place as one of the mosst widely read and influential works of twentieth-century fiction. As W.H. Auden wrote  ""Kafka is important to us because his predicament is the predicament of modern man."" 				    	 					              See all Product description"

"Capitalism in America: A History Review “This book snaps  crackles and pops....Three themes are highlighted — productivity as the measure of economic progress  the ‘Siamese twins of creation and destruction’ as the sources of productivity growth  and the political reaction to the consequences of creative destruction....Readers will emerge from this heady blend of economic  business  and political history with a sense of exhilaration that so much of the American experience could be described so vividly and insightfully.” —Financial Times  one of the Best Books of The Year in Economics“Capitalism in America makes a strong case  with some wonderful insights into business history. Innovation  spread to the masses  is indeed the engine of capitalist economies.” — The Economist ""Well worth reading."" — The Washington Post“A masterful guide to capitalism American style…You don’t have to be an economics wonk to enjoy and learn from Capitalism in America.” — The Washington Times “Strongly recommended.  This illuminating and in-depth history….is a valuable contribution to U.S. business history because it explains financial events and the culture of innovation from macro­economic perspectives and offers remarkable insights into the current business climate.” — Library Journal  starred review“A smart and engaging look at the workings of the economic machine under various regimes  isolationist and internationalist alike.” — Kirkus“A sweeping and brilliantly told narrative by two authors who have spent their careers thinking about the wellsprings of economic growth. Anchored by the combination of Alan Greenspan’s legendary skill with data and talent for analysis  and Adrian Wooldridge’s knowledge and perspective on business history  Capitalism in America is full of insights that will surprise you and change your perspective on many of the key episodes of U.S history.” — Liaquat Ahamed  author of Lords of Finance  winner of the 2010 Pulitzer Prize  “A work of bold sweep and illuminating insight that tells nothing less than the story of American capitalism—both its extraordinary achievements and its darkest moments—from the earliest days in colonies ‘at the edge of the world ’ to the Internet revolution. Greenspan and Wooldridge combine penetrating analysis with striking portraits of the people who made it all happen  which  together  demonstrate their theme of the constant capacity for innovation and reinvention. At a time when ‘capitalism’ itself is a subject of doubt and target of assault  this is a book that the times demand  and one that will contribute much to the debate.” — Daniel Yergin  author of The Prize and The Quest and co-author of Commanding Heights: the Battle for the World Economy    About the Author ALAN GREENSPAN was born in 1926 and reared in the Washington Heights neighborhood of New York City.

"On Directing Film Amazon.com Review According to David Mamet  a film director must  above all things  think visually. Most of this instructive and funny book is written in dialogue form and based on film classes Mamet taught at Columbia University. He encourages his students to tell their stories not with words  but through the juxtaposition of uninflected images. The best films  Mamet argues  are composed of simple shots. The great filmmaker understands that the burden of cinematic storytelling lies less in the individual shot than in the collective meaning that shots convey when they are edited together. Mamet borrows many of his ideas about directing  writing  and acting from Russian masters such as Konstantin Stanislavsky  Sergei M. Eisenstein  and Vsevelod Pudovkin  but he presents his material in so delightful and lively a fashion that he revitalizes it for the contemporary reader.

"I Don't Know What it is But I Love it Review Superbly paced. Full of riveting anecdotes about possibly Liverpool's finest campaign  the Treble in 1983-84. The book is worth the admission price alone for Evans' re-telling of Souey's jaw-busting encounter with Dynamo Bucharest's Lica Movila  followed by the Reds' triumph in Rome. This is how a football book should read (Mirror (Book of the Month))Evans' narrative never flags  the anecdotes are apt  and the blood on the streets and the boots on the field are as dramatic and black-humoured as on a battleground (The Times) 				    	 					 About the Author Tony Evans has been football editor of The Times for five years and was born a Liverpool fan. He writes a weekly column for The Game  The Times' weekly football supplement.

Islam is good Muslims should follow it AUTHOR’S NOTE I humbly say that my approach is slightly different. For example  this book has a chapter not specifically on Islamic Sharia  but on  “JUSTICE: By Muslims  and Others”. It juxtaposes the Islamic methods against that of other societies over the ages. I sincerely could not figure out how the Islamic method could claim to have evolved out of two very humane documents  the Quran and Prophet Muhammad’s Sunnah  and yet produce such outlandish juristic decisions as it does at times in the name of Islamic Sharia. I have tried to evolve a new concept which I call  THE THIRD FACTOR. It constitutes the last chapter  and is also mentioned in the opening pages of the book. There are some other deliberations in the book which a reader may find interesting. For example  I have tried to argue that contrary to common perception  the Quran discourages the Muslims to produce more children (pp. 198-201)  Prophet Muhammad’s Hadith about “women in hellfire” is wrongly interpreted by his critics (pp. 202-207)  he has been called a pedophile by cynics  while in my opinion he was essentially a one-woman-man! (pp. 85-89). REVIEWS “I have been an avid reader of Islamic literature for several years  but never came across such a fascinating book. It will delight students  teachers  imams and academicians alike. ...The book is an eye-opener  a must-read.” Moin Qazi THE ASIAN AGE 27 October 2017 “…It is a must read for believers and for those with stakes in a just and peaceful world.” Zakia Soman www.thecitizen.in 11 October 2017“Sanjiv Bhatla’s book is a …very necessary mirror to Muslims so that they wake up  realize where they have gone wrong…” Nigar Ataulla ISLAMIC VOICE October 2017

Healing Back Pain: The Mind-Body Connection Review “My life before Dr. Sarno was filled with excruciating back and shoulder pain. For twenty years I also suffered from obsessive-compulsive disorder and thought my back pain was due to my height or some sort of spine problem and that my OCD was a chemical imbalance and only treatable with medication. But all my thoughts were wrong. Imagine the miracle in my life when in a matter of weeks my back pain disappeared. Imagine my shock when I applied Dr. Sarno's principles and never suffered a single symptom again. Quite simply - I owe Dr. Sarno a lot.” ―Howard Stern“For fifteen years  my life revolved around my back. I took time off from work  conducted meetings lying on the floor and slept with ice bags. Could this be psychogenic? I had considered Dr. Sarno's ideas preposterous  but ten years ago I was talked into seeing him. I haven't had back problems since. If Dr. Sarno is right a about other psychogenic pain  America is wasting billions of dollars. What a tragedy.” ―John Stossel  correspondent  20/20“John Sanro has changed my life and the lives of all the people to whom I have recommended him. He was healing patients with the mind-body connection long before anyone else I know. He is a true miracle worker.” ―Ann Bancroft About the Author DR. JOHN E.

From AudioFile Twelve-year-old Percy Jackson knows he's different  but when a teacher becomes a deadly monster and his scrawny best friend turns out to be a satyr  he learns he's a hero--the half-blood son of an Olympian god. Narrator Jesse Bernstein artfully creates a variety of characters  including nervous goat-boy Grover and bossy wise-girl Annabeth (Athena's daughter)  but his masterpiece is the boyish and sarcastic Percy himself. Bernstein also rises to the challenge of giving voice to the Olympians. From Aries's growling and guttural snarls to Zeus's haughty tones  Bernstein breathes new life into these ancient characters.

There's not a dated maxim or vague prescription in it. 'To win without fighting is best ' Sun Tzu said. For him  war was coeval with life. Absorb this book  and you can throw out all those contemporary books about management leadership."" --Newsweek  About the Author Sun Tzu is known as a Chinese military strategist  Taoist philosopher  and general in the 6th century BCE who is widely recognized for his work The Art of War  a treatise on military strategy (also known as The Thirteen Chapters). Whether an individual by the name of `Sun-Tzu existed at all has been disputed (in the same way scholars and historians debate the existence of an actual man named Lao-Tzu) but the existence of The Art of War and its profound influence on military campaigns  clearly proves that someone existed to produce said work and that the work is attributed to one Sun-Tau.  Warfare in China was considered a kind of sport of the noble gentry in which chivalry prevailed and rules were not to be bent or broken. Prior to Boju (and for many years following) these rules were observed by the noble generals who led the armies of the various states of China.  Sun-Tzu changed the rules by applying Taoist principles to warfare and by refusing to consider war a sport. He wrote  In war  then  let your great object be victory  not lengthy campaigns. Thus it may be known that the leader of armies is the arbiter of the people's fate  the man on whom it depends whether the nation shall be in peace or in peril (2.19-20). Sun-Tzu had no patience with the protracted games generals seemed to enjoy playing with each other. Once hostilities had erupted  one s priority was to defeat the enemy  not indulge oneself in chivalry which could only prolong the conflict and cost more lives.  Sun-Tzu s The Art of War has been used effectively in military engagements from The Warring States Period to (intermittently) the present day and is considered a classic philosophical work on military strategy. Sun-Tzu s dictum that  All warfare is based on deception (1.18) has been cited as an essential component of any military campaign and  as his work has grown in popularity through many different translations  has also been made use of by the business community in their pursuit of success in commerce. -J.J.

"At The Grave Of The Unknown Fisherman From AudioFile For John Gierach  fishing is about letting go of the past and the future because ""living in the moment is the only way I know of to accurately understand life without getting pissed off."" If that line makes you smile  you'll get caught up in this audiobook even if you've never tied a fly or hooked a brookie. The story follows Gierach during a year of fishing-related travels in the U.S. and Canada  but the real journey is a stylistic one. Michael Prichard's narration is a perfect match to the writing. He's got just the right feel for Gierach's wisdom and dry sense of humor. D.B. © AudioFile 2007  Portland  Maine-- Copyright © AudioFile  Portland  Maine"

I hope women—and men—of my generation will read this book to help us build the lives we want to lead and the world we want to live in.”            —Chelsea Clinton “I approached it wearing two hats—one as CEO [and] the other as the parent of a nine-year-old daughter. In both capacities  I feel that Lean In is a must read.”            —Mohamed El-Erian  CEO of PIMCO  in Fortune “Inspirational . . . Sandberg offers concrete suggestions on how to make our work and home life more satisfying and successful.”            —Kare Anderson  Forbes  “What Sandberg offers is a view that shows 20-somethings that choices and tradeoffs surely exist  but that the ‘old normal’ of blunting ambition so that you can fit in one category or another does not have to be the way it is. And that each of us has a say in what comes next. And that includes men.”            —Gayle Tzemach Lemmon  The Atlantic  “Sheryl Sandberg has done a tremendous service with this work. It offers a vital and sharp message  for women and men. We need great leaders in key seats spread throughout all sectors of society  and we simply cannot afford to lose 50 percent of the smartest  most capable people from competing for those seats. Provocative  practical  and inspired!”            —Jim Collins  author of Good to Great “Sandberg recounts her own experiences and dilemmas with great honesty  making it easy for women across cultures and geographies to identify with her. She spells out much that is well known about the problems working women face  but rarely articulated . . . In every word she writes  Sandberg’s authenticity shines through.”            —Shweta Punj  Business Today“Lively  entertaining  urgent  and yes  even courageous . . . Lean In is both a radical read and incredibly accessible . . . While it’s obvious that women have much to gain from reading Sandberg’s book  so do men—perhaps even more so . . . Lean In is the beginning of an important and long-overdue conversation in the United States—but it will only be a national conversation  and one that endures  if men do their part and lean in  too.”            —Michael Cohen  The Guardian   “Grade: A . . . a rallying cry to working women . . . Lean In is the most cogent piece of writing I’ve encountered that speaks to the internal and institutional forces that can trip up an ambitious woman  whether she has a baby on board or not . . . The wisdom she shares here is a gift that all women (and all partners who support them  in the workplace or at home) should give themselves.”            —Meeta Agrawal  Entertainment Weekly  “If you loved Sheryl Sandberg’s incredible TEDTalk on why we have too few women leaders  or simply believe as I do that we need equality in the boardroom  then this book is for you. As Facebook’s COO  Sheryl Sandberg has firsthand experience of why having more women in leadership roles is good for business as well as society. Lean In is essential reading for anyone interested in righting the injustice of this inequality.”            —Sir Richard Branson  chairman  the Virgin Group  “Sandberg’s message matters deeply: it has a shot at bringing about a cultural change that would improve the lives of all women.”           —Judith Warner  TIME “A muscular manifesto on the gender inequities of the professional world . . . Sandberg is making a disruptive  crucial observation that puts her very much in line with Friedan: All is not just in the gendered world  and we should be talking urgently about how to make it better.”           —Rebecca Traister  Los Angeles Times  “No one who reads this book will ever doubt that Sandberg herself has the will to lead  not to mention the requisite commitment  intelligence  and ferocious work ethic . . . Sandberg is not just tough  however. She also comes across as compassionate  funny  honest  and likable . . . Most important  she is willing to draw the curtain aside on her own insecurities . . . Lean In is full of gems  slogans that ambitious women would do well to pin up on their wall . . . I nodded in recognition at so much of what Sandberg recounts  page after page.”            —Anne-Marie Slaughter  The New York Times Book Review (cover review)  “Pivotal . . . It’s probably not an overstatement to say Sandberg is embarking on the most ambitious mission to reboot feminism and reframe discussions of gender since the launch of Ms. magazine in 1971. The thing is  she’s in a pretty good position to pull it off.”            —Belinda Luscombe  TIME “Important . . . This is a great moment for all of us—women and men—to acknowledge that the current male-dominated model of success isn’t working for women  and it’s not working for men  either . . . The world needs women to redefine success beyond money and power. We need a third metric  based on our well-being  our health  our ability to unplug and recharge and renew ourselves  and to find joy in both our job and the rest of our life.”             —Arianna Huffington  Forbes “I’ll bet most [women] will be thrilled by Lean In. I suspect at least a few men will read this book and think  Oh no  they’re starting to catch on.”            —Michael Lewis  Vanity Fair “A lucidly written  well-argued  and unabashedly feminist take on women and work  replete with examples from the author’s life.”            —Julia Klein  USA Today  “Having read Lean In by Sheryl Sandberg  I can testify that it addresses internalized oppression  opposes the external barriers that create it  and urges women to support each other to fight both. It argues not only for women’s equality in the workplace  but men’s equality in home-care and child-rearing. Even its critics are making a deep if inadvertent point: Only in women is success viewed as a barrier to giving advice.”            —Gloria Steinem  “Lean In has plenty for feminists and all women to applaud—and learn from . . . I’m glad Sandberg is speaking out. I’m glad she’s using her platform to help give women the tools to succeed  and to encourage all of us to go out and get what we want. The real strength of Lean In is in its Rosie the Riveter 2.0 message: ‘You can do it! Here’s how.’ . . . A crucial call to action.”            —Jill Filipovic  The Guardian  “A call to live fearlessly . . . Lean In is a memoir  a self-help book  a career management guide  and a feminist manifesto . . . Let’s hope this is a book that is read as much as talked about.”             —Marion Winik  Newsday “Equality is a project everybody must work on together. For too long  achieving equality has been seen as women’s burden . . . By knowing this story  men will become more sophisticated thinkers and actors when it comes to gender . . . Lean In contains a whole lot for men to think seriously about . . . Men just need to read it.”            —Patrick Thibodeau  CIO Magazine   “Unapologetic . . . Sandberg is using her power and influence to try and improve the world . . . Sandberg’s most powerful rhetorical device in the book is a saturation of stats that are sometimes shocking and sometimes reverberating—but always the kind that make you reevaluate what’s going on around us.”             —Nicholas Carlson  Business Insider  “Sandberg’s voice is modest  humorous  warm  and enthusiastic . . . You don’t have to be climbing the corporate ladder—or  as Sandberg would call it  the jungle gym—to find her message useful. Don’t marry a man who isn’t egalitarian? Good plan! Be more confident? Excellent advice . . . I’m buying a copy of Lean In for my daughter and one for my stepdaughter  too.”            —Katha Pollitt  The Nation “Nuanced  persuasive  and brave . . . All of us—women and men alike—who care about creating a more equitable America ought to take her message to heart.”             —Jane Eisner  The Forward “After reading Lean In and listening to Sheryl  I realize that  while I believe I am relatively enlightened  I have not consistently walked the talk . . . I believe we—together—need to drive a fundamental culture change and it is up to us as leaders to make this change happen. What we have been doing hasn’t worked  and it is time to adjust . . . We have an opportunity to make a tremendous difference  and in so doing benefit our people  out culture  our company  and  just maybe  the world.”             —John Chambers  CEO  Cisco “Tremendously relevant . . . necessary . . . Lean In is more about being bold than it is about being female . . . Sandberg can reach beyond boundaries of age  success level  and gender to include all of those who have the privilege of playing on the jungle gym of corporations  academia  and government.”            —Sharon Poczter  Forbes        “A rallying cry for both genders to continue the hard work of previous generations toward a more equitable division of voice  power  and leadership . . . Told with candor and filled with a mix of anecdote and annotated fact  Lean In inspires women to find their passion  pursue it with gusto  and ‘lean in’ to leadership roles in the workplace and the world.”            —Linda Stankard  BookPage “I plan to buy Lean In for our three grown daughters and daughter-in-law . . . In our family  and in families across the country  may the conversations begin.”            —Connie Schultz  Washington Post “I’m guessing that the average boardroom doesn’t have much better gender equality than a team of cave hunters attacking a woolly mammoth 30 000 years ago. So what gives? A provocative answer comes from Sheryl Sandberg  who has written a smart book that attributes the gender gap  in part  to chauvinism and corporate obstacles—but also  in part  to women who don’t aggressively pursue opportunities . . . there is something real and important in what she says.”           —Nicholas Kristof  The New York Times  “Giving women the tools and skills they need to take themselves and society—worldwide—to the next level.”           —Leslie L. Kossoff  Technorati.com “Compelling . . . Sandberg writes with sophistication and thoughtful reflection . . . a book that has a powerful message but that is also full of personal vulnerability and first-hand anecdotes  packed with statistics and footnoted studies that back her points.”            —Susan Adams  Forbes  “Her ideas are reasonable  thoughtful—and necessary.”           —Michelle Goldberg  The Daily Beast “When was the last time anybody talked this much about a women’s place in the world  period? Sandberg’s Lean In is opening up the dialogue—and  in true Silicon Valley fashion  she’s made it scalable . . . It’s put words to what we’d long felt but couldn’t quite articulate

"Defending Beef: The Case for Sustainable Meat Production Review ""Nicolette Hahn Niman  a lawyer  vegetarian and cattle rancher  serves up a well-argued defense of an American icon: the hamburger. Passionate and persuasive  Hahn Niman delivers a tough-minded critique of industrial animal operations along with an eloquent case on behalf of pasture-raised beef. The good news? It's safe to eat steak again--so long as you know where it comes from.""--Marc Gunther  editor-at-large  Guardian Sustainable Business US ""It is so important that we free our minds of conventional beef wisdom and open up to the solution set that uses nature's wisdom as well as the smart agricultural practices of the future. In Defending Beef  Nicolette Hahn Niman gives us an exacting and compelling defense of land management that solves for environmental resiliency  human health  climate change mitigation  and prosperity. How could we not listen?""--Kat Taylor  CEO and co-founder  Beneficial State Bank  co-founder and director  Tomkat Ranch Educational Foundation ""Defending Beef clearly and unequivocally connects the dots for us on how vitally important raising pastured beef is to humanity. From increasing the glomalin in soil that helps create healthy grass  to sequestering carbon  battling desertification  enhancing the water supply  mitigating climate change  and promoting biodiversity  Nicolette Hahn Niman carefully draws a constellation for understanding just how our food production systems affect people  culture and our ecosystem--for good or ill. The case is airtight and the jury is in: Cattle on pasture are an integral part of the solution.""--Mary R. Cleaver  owner/executive chef  The Cleaver Company and The Green Table  New York City ""Issues related to the long-term health effects of red meat  saturated fat  sugar  and grains are complex and I see the jury as still out on many of them. While waiting for the science to be resolved  Hahn Niman's book is well worth reading for its forceful defense of the role of ruminant animals in sustainable food systems.""--Marion Nestle  Professor of Nutrition  Food Studies  and Public Health at New York University and author of What to Eat ""Nicolette Hahn Niman's Defending Beef is as timely as it is necessary. With patience and passion she separates truth from fiction in the emotional debate about the role of beef in our lives and the effect of its production on our planet. Far from being a bogeyman of climate change and other environmental concerns  she argues  cattle  when properly managed  can play an important role in local food systems  land health  and carbon sequestration. The key is treating cattle as an ally  not an enemy  and exploring opportunities instead of simply pointing fingers. In this exploration  Defending Beef leads the way!""--Courtney White  founder and creative director  Quivira Coalition  and author  Grass  Soil  Hope ""Nicolette Hahn Niman just became beef's most articulate advocate. In Defending Beef  she pivots gracefully between the personal and the scientific  the impassioned and the evenhanded.

There are huge land areas in this country that cannot be used for crops. The only way to grow food on these lands is grazing animals. Grazing done properly will improve the land. Defending Beef shows clearly that beef cattle are an important part of sustainable agriculture.""--Temple Grandin  author of Animals Make Us Human and Professor of Animal Science at Colorado State University ""Defending Beef is a brave  clear-headed  and necessary addition to the discussion about sustainable food systems. Using hard data and solid scientific research  Nicolette Hahn Niman  a lawyer turned rancher  presents a convincing case that everything we thought we knew about the environmental and human health damage caused by beef is just plain wrong.""--Barry Estabrook  author  Tomatoland: How Modern Industrial Agriculture Destroyed our Most Alluring Fruit ""I hope this book  which is more about the future of humanity  will be read by every citizen--not just those who feel the need to defend their meat-eating preferences. Biologist  environmental lawyer  and mother Nicolette Hahn Niman has provided a balanced report on the effects of cattle production on our environment  health  and climate change. Openly accepting the damage done by modern-day cattle production--on the land and in factory feedlots--she effectively argues that cattle themselves are not the problem  it is the way they are being managed that is endangering our health  environment  and economy. We can do something about that  and we must for the sake of our children and grandchildren. Key to our success will be an informed citizenry--for whom this book will be an invaluable tool.""--Allan Savory  founder and president  the Savory Institute Acres U.S.A.- ""The irony could not be more acute  for this vegetarian makes as forceful and compelling a case for rational livestock husbandry as could be imagined. ... A wealth of personal experience percolates through her case  giving it detail  color and emotional logic. ... The trick to telling this kind of story has to do with rendering reams of data into a relatively swift narrative without oversimplifying it. Whether telling the story of Allan Savory and mob grazing or recapping the findings of the late John Yudkin--author of Pure  White and Deadly that fingered sugar for crimes against health 40 years ago--Hahn Niman never misses a step. ... Defending Beef gives advocates of sustainable livestock a powerful weapon."" The Wall Street Journal- ""Using a potent mix of scientific data and neoteric theories about health and environment  Ms. Niman makes a convincing case that grass-fed cattle should be a part of a sustainable food culture. If I were not already a consumer of grass-fed beef (I buy it frozen)  I would be upon reading this book. ... The problems with beef today 'are problems of land management  water resources  pollution  animal welfare  and food safety  ' Ms. Niman writes. She honors the cattleman culture  hoping the industry will self-correct  and to that end she shares the techniques that her husband developed to produce great-tasting grass-fed beef. Some of the author's observations touch on larger topics  like the gross amount of food waste in this country (a whopping 50% of all food produced) and how our system of food subsidies 'leads us to eat an abundance of unhealthy foods.' These problems actually suggest pathways by which you and I might drive change  but they are not explored here. That may be because 'Defending Beef' is true to its title: It seeks to persuade  not inflame.""

Nicolette Hahn Niman had me at the chapter  'All Food Is Grass  ' where she unpacks the complex clash of views over animal rights  ecology  and the legacy of human impact upon bioregions. The more I read  the more I came to value the passion and insight of someone who (like me) does not herself consume meat but recognizes that it rests at the center of what's troubling with our food system and how we might set it right. At Slow Food  we believe that better  less meat should become a rallying cry for a shift in our relationship to animals and each other. Scale  biodiversity  and rural economies get ample attention in this comprehensive yet easy-to-digest manifesto. If we ever hope to challenge the prevailing culture of confinement that defines the industrial meat system today then we need to make this book required reading for butchers  bakers and policymakers.""--Richard McCarthy  executive director  Slow Food USA ""In our collective confusion and desperation about the environment  many zero in on cattle as an unlikely culprit for everything from water pollution to climate change. In Defending Beef  author  rancher and environmental lawyer Nicolette Hahn Niman takes a nuanced look at the impact of livestock on land  water  the atmosphere  and human health.

Cattle--and common sense--have found their champion.""--Judith D. Schwartz  author  Cows Save the Planet ""The prosecution will never rest after the case presented here by this unusually well-armed defense lawyer. Exactly how much and in what ways cattle benefit our world--whether or not we eat beef--have never been more thoroughly explained. Cattle are lucky to have such a remarkable rancher gal come to their aid on our behalf.""--Betty Fussell  author  Raising Steaks: The Life and Times of American Beef ""Anyone hesitating to eat beef due to environmental or nutritional concerns needs to learn the other side of the story. Defending Beef is both scientifically accurate and highly readable.

Defending Beef proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that we can feel good about eating beef that's raised the right way.""--Steve Ells  founder and CEO  Chipotle Mexican Grill ""Creating healthful  delicious food in ecological balance is among humanity's greatest challenges. In this insightful book  Nicolette Hahn Niman shows why cattle on grass are an essential element. Every chef in America should read this book.""--Alice Waters  executive chef  founder/owner  Chez Panisse  Berkeley  CA Library Journal- ""Niman (Righteous Porkchop)  previously a senior attorney for the Waterkeeper Alliance  has a simple premise: 'We should eat what our bodies evolved to eat.' This title lays out her arguments in two sections. The first deals with cattle and how intensive factory farming has had a deleterious effect on certain environmental aspects of raising beef  but the author contends that these have been overstated. The link to climate change has been exaggerated  according to Niman  who claims that if cattle were permitted to graze on grass as they were evolutionarily designed to do  alteration to the earth's temperature might be mitigated  as this would promote carbon sequestration. Traditional cattle farming has other benefits  such as connecting people to the land and to the rhythms of the seasons. The book's second part enumerates the health benefits of beef. -Niman contends that bad science from the 1960s has led us to believe that fat and cholesterol should be avoided. We have switched to a diet that is heavy in sugars and carbohydrates and this has resulted in an increase in many chronic health conditions. The author maintains that a switch to less-processed foods and meats would reverse this trend. VERDICT As a vegetarian  -Niman is an intriguing spokesperson for the beef industry. Her arguments seem sound and well researched. Recommended reading for those interested in the links between diet and health."" Publishers Weekly- ""After learning from her rancher husband the benefits of raising and eating beef  Niman (Righteous Porkchop) delivers a head-on attack against everything negative that has been said about the cattle industry. An environmental lawyer and vegetarian  Niman is a force of nature when it comes to debunking the untruths about how raising beef effects global warming  the connection between eating beef and heart disease  and that eating beef is the reason Americans are fatter than ever. Reading Niman's pointed and convincing prose  like when she states: 'compared with other ways of producing food  the keeping of grazing livestock  when done appropriately  is the most environmentally benign  ' one can only imagine challenging her combination of intelligence  passion  and thoroughness. Despite the title  Niman isn't always on the defensive. In fact  she continually proposes ideas how to make meat production better by promoting the land- and animal-friendly practices of free-range  grass-fed ranching as a safer  more ecological  and healthier alternative to BigAg and industrial meat farming. Niman saves some of her most convincing and damning criticisms for her own vegetarianism as she demonstrates how raising livestock is not only a better option for the world's hungry masses  but also a better option for the planet's health. It sounds hard to believe  but Niman is almost impossible to disagree with."" The Los Angeles Times- ""If you are looking for a book to inspire fisticuffs at the Thanksgiving table  you've found it. Her ""manifesto"" calls for a revolutionized food system -- one that requires cows. ... One after another  Hahn Niman skewers the  ahem  sacred cows of the anti-meat orthodoxy. Eating meat causes world hunger? No  livestock are critical food (and cash) for 1 billion global poor  many living where plant crops cannot be grown. Deforestation? Forests are cleared primarily for soy  almost none of which goes to feed cows. Red meat and animal fat are the cause of the current epidemic of cardiovascular disease? The 1953 Keys study that spawned this belief actually showed no causation between the two and pushed us into the deadly grip of trans-fats and the true killer: sugar. Overgrazing ruined the American West? No  it was improper grazing and  in some cases  not enough cattle. ... She's not trying to change your mind  she's trying to save your world. And if you're an eater trying to pick your way through this divisive debate  you're cheering the information on every page."" ""A longtime critic of industrial agriculture and a lawyer by training  Niman mounts a lawyerly case for pasture-based beef production. She does so from an interested position. She's the wife of Bill Niman  one of the nation's most celebrated grass-based ranchers. But critics who want to dismiss Niman's advocacy on economic-interest grounds have to grapple with the mountains of evidence she brings to bear. The main ecological question that haunts grass-fed beef involves climate change. Cows emit methane  a greenhouse gas far more potent than carbon  when they burp  which is often. But by grazing  they also promote healthy  flourishing grasslands  which suck carbon from the atmosphere and store it in soil. In doing so  they convert a wild vegetation that people can't digest into a highly nourishing foodstuff. So on balance  do cows contribute to or mitigate climate change? The conventional view holds that the burps win. Niman casts more than reasonable doubt on that verdict. Citing loads of research  she argues that enteric emissions (methane from burps) are likely overstated and can be curtailed by breeding and techniques like abundant salt licks  and more than offset by the carbon-gulping capacity of intensive grazing (where farmers run dense herds through a pasture for a short time  and then give the land plenty of time to recover). She also shows that healthy pastures also provide plenty of other benefits  including habitat for pollinating insects and birds  which are declining rapidly as industrial grain farming--mostly for grain to feed confined animals--expands.""--Tom Philpott  Mother Jones  Best Food Books of 2014 The Art of Eating- ""Serious thinking about food and agriculture fills Defending Beef: The Case for Sustainable Meat Production (Chelsea Green  softcover  $19.95).The beef Nicolette Hahn Niman defends is unprocessed  raised outdoors using humane methods on pasture or range. A lawyer  married to a rancher  she started with an anti-meat bias and remains a vegetarian (seemingly from habit). She answers criticism that cattle-raising contributes to desertification  world hunger  and global warming. She presents the ecological importance of trampling by hooves -- natural grasslands are a product of wild-animal grazing. The key for ranchers is well-timed pauses to let plants regrow. Problems come when grazing land is left to ""rest"" too long. Real environmental damage  she argues  comes from plowing up grasslands to plant crops. ... Most of her assertions come with references to scientific studies pro and con. Niman believes red meat is healthful  taking an Atkins-esque view that animal fat is not responsible for making people fat. In contrast to her own diet  she tentatively proposes: ""We should eat what our bodies evolved to eat"" -- mainly meat and wild plants. And she ties benign methods to the highest quality beef  giving her rancher husband's view that the best taste comes from the meat of British breeds  the cattle are at least two years old and fattened on the year's best grass. Beef is ideally a seasonal meat  she argues  although she doesn't believe it harms cattle to feed them some grain."" ""I have long wished for a single compilation with all the scientific evidence that counters the charges of the anti-beef propagandists. Well  now we have it.

A History of Elizabethan Literature The history of the earlier Elizabethan prose is emphatically the Period of Origins of modern English prose  and as such cannot but be interesting. We shall therefore rapidly survey its chief develop­ments  noting first what had been done before Elizabeth came to the throne  then taking Ascham (who stands  though part of his work was written earlier  very much as the first Elizabethan prosaist)  noticing the schools of historians  translators  con­troversialists  and especially critics who illustrated the middle period of the reign  and singling out the noteworthy personality of Sidney. We shall also say something of Lyly (as far as Euphues is concerned) and his singular attempts in prose style  and shall finish with Hooker  the one really great name of the period.

Software Architecture in Practice  3rd Edition The award-winning and highly influential Software Architecture in Practice  Third Edition  has been substantially revised to reflect the latest developments in the field. In a real-world setting  the book once again introduces the concepts and best practices of software architecture—how a software system is structured and how that system’s elements are meant to interact. Distinct from the details of implementation  algorithm  and data representation  an architecture holds the key to achieving system quality  is a reusable asset that can be applied to subsequent systems  and is crucial to a software organization’s business strategy. The authors have structured this edition around the concept of architecture influence cycles. Each cycle shows how architecture influences  and is influenced by  a particular context in which architecture plays a critical role. Contexts include technical environment  the life cycle of a project  an organization’s business profile  and the architect’s professional practices. The authors also have greatly expanded their treatment of quality attributes  which remain central to their architecture philosophy—with an entire chapter devoted to each attribute—and broadened their treatment of architectural patterns.

Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions About the Author Edwin A. Abbott (1838–1926)  a Victorian of great intellect and wit  enjoyed success not only as a writer  but as a scholar  educator  and theologian. Educated at St. John’s College  Cambridge  he was Headmaster of the City of London School from 1865 to 1889. During that time  his progressive belief in the importance of the study of English for every student  even before traditional classic curriculum  led him to write A Shakespearian Grammar (1870) “to help solve most of the difficulties that will present themselves to boys.” It ran to three editions within its first year of publication alone and continues to be a touchstone for Shakespearean scholars. In 1884  he wrote Flatland. First considered by many as merely “a pleasant tonic  and an excellent stimulant for boys ” it was later recognized as a magnificent work of science fiction  as prophetic as those of Jules Verne and H. G. Wells. Retiring to a scholarly life in 1889  he produced numerous other works  including Silanus the Christian (1907)  Apologia: An Explanation and Defense (1907)  Message of the Son of Man (1909)  and Light on the Gospel from an Ancient Poet (Odes of Solomon) (1913). Valerie M. Smith earned her PhD from the University of Connecticut. An associate professor of English at Quinnipiac University in Hamden  Connecticut  she is currently at work on a manuscript entitled Crossroads: Cultural Autobiography and Imperial Discourse. John Allen Paulos is a Professor of Mathematics at Temple University and the bestselling author of eight books including Innumeracy  A Mathematician Reads the Newspaper  and Once upon a Number. He has been a columnist for ABCNews.com  Scientific American  and the Guardian  as well as the author of numerous reviews  articles  and op-ed pieces for a variety of publications. Among his many honors are the American Association for the Advancement of Science Award for Promoting Public Understanding of Science and the 2013 Mathematics Communication Award from the Joint Policy Board for Mathematics.

"A Time to Dance Review * “In Venkatraman’s delectably scented  sensual world  lyrically told through verse and through Veda  life is illuminated as a beautiful celebration of doing what comes naturally  as best as one is able. Veda's awakening of her gift throughout her altered body and revolutionary prosthesis provides a spiritually uplifting premise. . . . . The acclaimed author of Climbing the Stairs  Venkatraman deftly shapes readers’ comprehension of physical ability into a new arc of understanding. To even have a passing thought that Veda is disabled  rather than differently-abled  would be utter madness. Set against a cardamom  melted butter  and semolina sojji-wafted landscape  the novel’s emotional expression and accompanying music impel the reader to share Veda’s belief that ‘Shiva dances everywhere. In everyone. In everything.’” — Booklist  STARRED REVIEW* “Weaves together several themes so elegantly that they become one: Veda’s bodily exertion  learning to dance with her prosthetic leg  her process of changing her dance technique to be emotional and spiritual as well as physical  and all the rest of Veda’s life  including young love  grief  insecurity and a dawning awareness of class issues. . . . Fluid first-person verse. . . . Veda’s no disabled saint  awkwardness and jealousy receive spot-on portrayals. . . .A beautiful integration of art  religion  compassion and connection.” — Kirkus Reviews  STARRED REVIEW* “The descriptions of contemporary India are beautiful and Venkatraman weaves images so divine that you can see the statues of Shiva  hear the ankle bells in the bharatanatyam dance  and smell the acrid scent of burnt rubber from the accident. Told in verse  this story is magnificently strong as Veda’s determination dances off the page and into the reader’s heart.” — VOYA  STARRED REVIEW* “This exceptional novel  told entirely in verse  captures beautifully the emotions of a girl forced to deal with a number of challenges and how she overcomes them on her way to becoming a confident young woman. It is sure to appeal to readers who are also trying to find their place in the world.” — School Library Journal  STARRED REVIEW* “Deftly wrought free-verse. . . . The language is lilting and rhythmic . . . the sensory elements evocatively describe the sights and sounds of Veda’s rich Indian surroundings. Her existential ponderings . . . are woven seamlessly into the tale  and her moments of jealousy and rage are presented honestly. Heart-achingly hopeful and beautifully written  this story will remain with readers long after the final line of verse.” — The Bulletin of the Center for Children's Books  STARRED REVIEW“Brief lines  powerful images  and motifs of sound communicate Veda’s difficult struggle to accept her changed body—and her new limitations  especially in dance. . . . Subplots exploring other loves and losses also help Veda learn about herself  her faith  and her art. And  eventually  after a successful return to dance  Veda again feels whole.” — The Horn Book  About the Author Padma Venkatraman (www.padmasbooks.com) is an oceanographer by training and a writer by choice. Her critically acclaimed novels Climbing the Stairs and Island’s End were both ALA/YALSA Best Books for Young Adults  Booklist Editor's Choice BBYAs  Amelia Bloomer list selections and CCBC choices  in addition to winning several other honors and awards (such as the South Asia Book Award  Paterson Prize  Julia Ward Howe BAC award  NYPL Book for the Teen Age  Kirkus Best Book of the Year  Booksense Notable  and PW Flying Start).

S. Chand's Mental Mathematics for Class 1 
A Writer's Diary The essential entries from Dostoevsky's complete Diary  called his boldest experiment in literary form  are now available in this abridged edition  it is a uniquely encyclopedic forum of fictional and nonfictional genres.A Writer's Diary began as a column in a literary journal  but by 1876 Dostoevsky was able to bring it out as a complete monthly publication with himself as an editor  publisher  and sole contributor  suspending work onThe Brothers Karamazov to do so.The Diary's radical format was matched by the extreme range of its contents. In a single frame it incorporated an astonishing variety of material: short stories  humorous sketches  reports on sensational crimes  historical predictions  portraits of famous people  autobiographical pieces  and plans for stories  some of which were never written while others appeared later in theDiary itself. A range of authorial and narrative voices and stances and an elaborate scheme of allusions and cross-references preserve and present Dostoevsky's conception of his work as a literary whole.Selected from the two-volume set  this abridged edition of A Writer's Diary appears in a single paperback volume  along with a new condensed introduction by editor Gary Saul Morson.

[A] crucial voice in the public discussion of race and equality  and readers will be eager for his take on where we stand now and why (Booklist)It's this timeless timeliness--reminiscent of the work of George Orwell and James Baldwin--that makes Coates worth reading again and again (Publishers Weekly)Fiercely passionate  intelligent and clear-eyed (Newsday)Across his oeuvre  Coates' prose style and literary prowess are hip-hop sharpened: he believes in the art of dexterous reference  potent  lyrical critique and political storytelling (Baltimore Sun)Coates's probing essays about race  politics  and history became necessary ballast for this nation's gravity-defying moment...

You'll never forget his point of view  nor should you (Glamour)Thus  We Were Eight Years in Power serves as a clarion call for vigilance about the possible erosion of African-American advances presumed sacrosanct. Consider these riveting  well-reasoned ruminations of the most-prodigious black visionary around a must-read indeed (The Mississippi Link) 				    	 					 From the Inside Flap In this essential follow-up to Between the World and Me  Ta-Nehisi Coates bears witness to the extraordinary eight-year period in American history which began with the unprecedented election of a black president  Barack Obama  and ended  following a vicious backlash  with the election of the man Coates argues is America's 'first white president'. We Were Eight Years in Power powerfully examines the events of the Obama era from an intimate and revealing perspective: the point of view of a young writer who begins his journey in an unemployment office in Harlem and ends it in the Oval office  interviewing a president. The story of these eight years reaches far beyond presidential politics. It is the story of the new voices  ideas and movements that emerged over this period - and the effects of the persistent  haunting shadow of America's old and unreconciled history of slavery and white supremacy.Seamlessly combining history  memoir  argument and reportage  We Were Eight Years in Power is a vital  eloquent and impassioned account of modern America from one of the definitive voices of this historic moment.

"Poonachi: Or the Story of a Black Goat Review “Poonachi is a classic Perumal Murugan novel  empathetically illuminating lives of quiet dignity overrun by subjugation and hardship... It’s a bleak coming-of-age tale that recalls classics like Black Beauty and Watership Down.  Like those novels  the social and political commentaries in Poonachi are veiled behind a tale that is ostensibly about goats… Murugan’s style  as always  is sparse. Born into a family of Gounder farmers in the Kongu region of Tamil Nadu  he effortlessly evokes the sights  sounds and smells of the place…” - Mint Lounge About the Author “After two years of being in exile  I feared to write about humans and it was far more difficult to write about Gods. When I started to write  I didn’t know I knew so much about a goat and it later on developed into a book.” … “I don’t know if I believe in god or not  but I question the need to worship or believe in god.” … ""The goat is one animal that is close to my heart and one that I'm quite familiar with  so I thought writing about the animal will help me break out of the writer's block.""… “A lot of foreign literature focuses on generic issues. However  in India  there is a different story everywhere.”- Perumal MuruganPerumal Murugan is the author of six novels  four collections of short stories and four anthologies of poetry in Tamil. Three of his novels have been translated into English: Seasons of the Palm  which was shortlisted for the Kiriyama Prize in 2005  Current Show and One Part Woman.  He was a professor of Tamil at the Government Arts College in Namakkal before taking to writing full-time. N. Kalyan Raman is a Chennai-based translator of contemporary Tamil fiction and poetry into English.

"Down Girl: The Logic of Misogyny Review Down Girl leaves the reader wanting more  and Manne eagerly invites both scholars and her general audience to fill in those gaps. Rich conversations and literatures will surely follow in this book's wake. (Thomas E. Randall  Hypatia Reviews)Despite its somber topic  Kate Manne's Down Girl made me very happy  exhilarated indeed by its insight  analytical clarity  and committed engagement with a major issue of justice. I've been thinking and teaching about sexism and misogyny for a long time  but this book opened up fresh perspectives  for example in its convincing distinction between sexism as a set of beliefs and misogyny as an enforcement strategy. Each thoughtful person will have her own sense of where to locate the root of injustice to women  but Manne's cogent argument that misogyny is primarily about the demand that women give support  service  and care is surely at least one big part of the story of our turbulent times. (Martha C. Nussbaum  School of Law and Department of Philosophy  University of Chicago)Persuasively defining 'misogyny' as hostile  demeaning  shaming  and punitive treatment of women  Down Girl brings out the misogynist logic of contemporary culture with wit and urgency. In this book 'misogyny' emerges as the law enforcement branch of patriarchy  and thus as a concept that fully deserves a place alongside 'patriarchy' and 'sexism' as a fundamental tool for feminist analysis. Combining conceptual clarity with passionate commitment  Down Girl is indispensable reading for anyone who wishes to understand the ugly strand of hostility to women that has surfaced in recent years in our so-called advanced Western societies. (Toril Moi  Duke University)Kate Manne's brilliant Down Girl is a welcome antidote to the view that philosophy is (or should be)Kate Manne has written a deeply moving and powerful book. It is politically engaged philosophical analysis at its best. (Sarah Song  University of California  Berkeley)Manne's important new book deploys the tools of analytic moral philosophy to construct an arresting account of the logic of misogyny. It is sure to become a key reference point for future discussions of this vital  but hitherto sadly neglected  topic. (John Tasioulas  King's College London)Manne offers us a deep  insightful  and thought-provoking (if depressing)Manne's Down Girl: The Logic of Misogyny is excruciatingly well-timed  providing a theoretical framework for a phenomenon baring itself before us  perverse and pervasive... Down Girl reminds us that while revealing individual misogynists is hard  uprooting misogyny is much harder. (Carlos Lozada  The Washington Post)Manne brings a fresh analysis to our assumed understanding of misogyny and the related term sexism. As a feminist and moral philosopher... not a single book or article-length treatment [in the field] had been devoted to unpacking what it is and how it works. Historians  pay attention. Manne has stepped up to fill this gap... Manne as a feminist philosopher breaks new ground in a field that is in need of new perspectives...Having fought for recognition for the legitimacy of their method  feminist philosophers are firmly committed to excavating the political  epistemological  and moral aspects of gender relations. Down Girl should encourage historians who trace changes in the meaning and the context of language to revisit some of the old standby terms of feminism. (Lilian Calles Barger  Society for US Intellectual History)Down Girl: The Logic of Misogyny by feminist philosopher Kate Manne... argues that misogyny pits women against each other: the good wife vs. ""feminazis."" At a time when high-profile sexual predators have been exposed  I can't imagine a more relevant read.

As the daughter of famed conceptual artist Dennis Oppenheim. By age nine  Chandra was staying up late at her parents art-world parties  collaborating in her father s projects  and performing her own plays at downtown hotspots such as The Kitchen and Franklin Furnace. This set the stage for Chandra s course-altering collaboration with members of The Dance  who were looking to form yet another project and found their muse/fuse in 10 year-old Chandra. Transportation EP  originally released in 1980 by The Dance s own label  ON/GoGo. Balancing on razor- wire guitars  liquid basslines  and dub-style melodica  the Chandra band unveiled their first four songs: Opposite   Concentration   Subways   and Kate. While Chandra s music can be compared to her no wave contemporaries Y Pants  France s Lizzy Mercier Descloux  Su Tissue of Suburban Lawns  or Delta 5 meets the Jackson 5   to quote critic David Ma  her lyrical fixations are truly singular. With hypnotic  chanted vocals focusing on chilling themes of mind control  multiple personalities and missing the train. At age 12  the post-punk pre-teen took the stage with her band for the first time at New York s legendary Mudd Club. A whirlwind of press coverage ensued from glossy magazines like Vogue and Paris Match to the influential underground zine Non LP B Side and a Soho News cover story. The infectious  propulsive Get It Out Of Your System opens Chandra s second EP with one of her most commanding performances. Stranger slows the pace with stop-start rhythms  woozy synths  and the harmonized return of the melodica  while its lyrics find her being followed by a mysterious character revealed to be a woman. Tish Le Dire sounds like The B-52s in an eerie alternate universe with instructions on speaking up to your parents or authorities to the point of threatening suicide. Chandra stepped away from the band at age 14 to focus on her education. Sadly  the second EP was shelved and would not see the light of day for decades. Chandra s trip continues with this new deluxe reissue from Telephone Explosion Records. Returning her debut EP to its original foursong  single-record release at a dancefloor-ready remastered 45 RPM  the expanded edition also adds to the second EP with a pair of never released songs from her 1983 four-track cassette demos. Day Without Success and They re All Alike find Chandra s dreamlike vocals driven by minimal wave synth zaps and pulsating drum machines Transportation EPs"" will be released on gatefold 2xLP / digital on November 9th  2018."

CA FOUNDATION SOLVED SCANNER PAPER 1 TO 4 GREEN EDITION COMBO AND JANUARY 2018 EDITION
Language Across The Curriculum The paper on Language across the curriculum (LAC) has been made an integral part oftwo years REd. Programme according to NCTE  2014 rules and regulations. According to this  every teacher is therefore by definition a language teacher. There are perhaps two basic and intertwining principles behind introducing this LAC paper. Firstly  it is believed that language plays a central role in learning. No matter what the subject area is  students understand new concepts when they listen  talk  read and write about what they are learning. Therefore if their language is weak  so is their learning. Secondly  language learning is most successful in a meaningful context. In the LAC classroom the emphasis moves away from language as the subject to be studied and is placed on content and process. In short  LAC is one that integrates language learning and content learning. LAC is an approach to learning that focuses on improving language proficiency in all subjects in order to enhance students' learning and outcomes. LAC acknowledges that language education does not only take place in specific subjects such as English Lessons  but language learning also takes place in each and every subject  in every learning activity  and across the whole curriculum. LAC emphasizes that language development is the responsibility of all teachers across the school and in all subject areas.

These are one of the most enduring lines that still lay etched in my memory. I have read this book long back  and I don't remember when  but surely the essence remains with me even today. This book is best suited for reading for the teenagers  to dream and to dare. It shows  how a person from the modest background ends up in being the First Citizen of a nation of one billion. It shows how a scientist  devoid of basic tools  helps in culmination of a program which other love to loathe and deride. It shows a man  who lived his life in terms of his principles and nothing else. It shows how a common man  like you and me  can achieve when he can dream. And finally  it teaches how to dream --Tarun Mitra on Apr 26  2012This is the most inspiring book I have ever read. Great salute to the man for his contribution to Indian Rocketry.I would like to recall few lines from book. 1. What you imagine  is what you transpire.What you believe is what you achieve. 2. A good plan executed violently right now is far better than a perfect plan executed next week. 3. Once your mind stretches to a new level it never goes back to its original dimension. 4.

His classic novella The Old Man and the Sea won the Pulitzer Prize in 1953. Hemingway was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1954. He died in 1961.Josh Lucas' film credits include: Poseidon  Glory Road  The War  Stealth  Around the Bend  Undertow  Wonderland  Hulk  Sweet Home Alabama  A Beautiful Mind  The Deep End  and American Psycho. Lucas' theatre credits include: The Glass Menagerie and Corpus Christi. 				    	 					 From AudioFile Fans of Ernest Hemingway will certainly enjoy the story of the author's month-long safari in East Africa in 1933 with his wife  Pauline. Replete with tales about the thrill of chasing big game  the joys of the kill  and the lushness of the scenery  this is truly classic Hemingway. It also serves as further proof that you either love his unique style or you don't. Narrator Josh Lucas clearly understands the author and delivers the material with a resonance and assurance that add to Hemingway's confident and passionate tone. Lucas has a fine sense of timing  along with a deft ability to add subtle yet distinct emphasis to key scenes. D.J.S. © AudioFile 2007  Portland  Maine-- Copyright © AudioFile  Portland  Maine"

"Chaos Media: A Sonic Economy of Digital Space Review Digitally induced sound has become a key element of contemporary societies  moving back and forth across various media as both shuttle and content. But appreciating this fact is not the same as understanding it. This book is a step towards understanding this new sonic economy  one which never makes the mistake of reducing it to just matters of political economy. It therefore provides a rich and accomplished account of new forms of sonic patterning and their spatial manifestations which is simultaneously a technological reckoning and a signpost to the future. * Nigel Thrift  Vice-Chancellor and President  University of Warwick  UK * We all too often privilege sight  at the expense of the other senses. Drawing on a wide range of sources  from Leibniz to McLuhan to complexity theory  Stephen Kennedy explains why this is wrong  especially when it comes to the digital spaces that we inhabit today. Chaos Media calls on us to make an acoustic turn  and to listen to those aspects of our technological environment that cannot be visualized * Steven Shaviro  Professor of English  Wayne State University  USA. * 				    	 					 About the Author Stephen Kennedy is a researcher and lecturer in critical theory and the digital arts at the University of Greenwich  UK."

The Case for Books: Past  Present  and Future Review The New Republic “Darnton’s volume is an informed and realistic guide to life in the first age of digital media. It argues convincingly that digitalization will create—is already creating—a new kind of enlightenment  if not a new Enlightenment…It seems entirely possible that Darnton will show scholars how we can make the digital world our servant  instead of accepting it as our master  and use it not to undermine but to complement the old powers of narrative and argument.”Bookpage “Darnton knows this territory as well as anyone and views the subject from a unique perspective…Darnton’s thoughtful and incisive essays on this important topic should be of interest to a wide range of book lovers.”The Scotsman “Darnton’s book ticks all the boxes. It looks nice. It smells nice. Its content is intelligent and forms a valuable primer to an increasingly important debate.”Times Higher Education Supplement “(an) important and highly readable book.”Bookpage “Darnton knows this territory as well as anyone and views the subject from a unique perspective…Darnton’s thoughtful and incisive essays on this important topic should be of interest to a wide range of book lovers.”Booklist “Historian and library director Darnton has written expansively and lucidly on the history of books and libraries.

Fundamentals of Astrodynamics (Dover Books on Aeronautical Engineering) From the Back Cover When the United States Air Force Academy began teaching astrodynamics to undergraduates majoring in astronautics or aerospace engineering  it found that the traditional approach to the subject was well over 100 years old. An entirely new text had to be evolved  geared to the use of high speed digital computers and actual current practice in the industry. Over the years the new approach was proven in the classrooms of the Academy  its students entering graduate engineering schools were found to possess a better understanding of astrodynamics than others. So pressing is the need for superior training in the aerospace sciences that the professor-authors of this text decided to publish it for other institutions' use. This Dover edition is the result.The text is structured for teaching. Central emphasis is on use of the universal variable formulation  although classical methods are discussed. Several original unpublished derivations are included. A foundation for all that follows is the development of the basic two-body and n-body equations of motion  orbit determination is then treated  and the classical orbital elements  coordinate transformations  and differential correction. Orbital transfer maneuvers are developed  followed by time-of-flight with emphasis on the universal variable solution. The Kepler and Gauss problems are treated in detail. Two-body mechanics are applied to the ballistic missile problem  including launch error analysis and targeting on a rotating earth. Some further specialized applications are made to lunar and interplanetary flight  followed by an introduction to perturbation  special perturbations  integration schemes and errors  and analytic formulation of several common perturbations.Example problems are used frequently  while exercises at the end of each chapter include derivations and quantitative and qualitative problems. The authors suggest how to use the text for a first course in astrodynamics or for a two-course sequence.This major instructional tool effectively communicates the subject to engineering students in a manner found in no other textbook. Its efficiency has been thoroughly demonstrated. Dover feels privileged in joining with the authors to make its concepts and text matter available to other faculties.A new work  first published by Dover in 1971.

Excerpt. © Reprinted by permission. All rights reserved. Chapter 1Protection from AboveA thick layer of clouds blocked out any light. There were no stars and there was no moon. Just black. The team slowly made its way through the valley  the rocky terrain making it impossible to go any faster than a snail's pace. Worse  they knew they were being watched. Every one of them was on edge.A year hadn't yet passed since the attacks of September 11. The Taliban government had only recently fallen after taking a pounding from U.S. forces for their refusal to turn over the Al Qaeda leader  Osama bin Laden. There were a lot of Special Operations Forces in the area performing missions that  to this day  are still classified. This was one of those teams and this was one of those missions.All we know is that the team of twenty-two men was operating deep inside enemy territory and had recently captured what the government calls a ""high-value target."" They were now working their way through a deep valley in a mountainous part of Afghanistan  escorting their high-value target to a safe house.Flying over the thick clouds that night was Captain Mike Drowley  or Johnny Bravo  as he is known by his call sign or nickname. Except for the whir of his engines  it was perfectly peaceful up there. Thousands of stars speckled the sky  and the moon lit up the top of the clouds so brightly it looked like a fresh layer of snow had fallen. It was beautiful.Johnny Bravo and his wingman were circling above in their A-10 aircraft  waiting should they be needed below. Affectionately known as the Warthog  the A-10 is not technically a fighter jet  it's an attack aircraft. A relatively slow-flying  single-seat armored plane designed to provide close air support for troops on the ground. Unlike other fighter jets  it is not fast or sexy (hence the nickname)  but it gets the job done.Ideally  both the A-10 pilots in the air and the troops on the ground would prefer to see each other with their eyes. Seeing the plane above  knowing someone is looking out for them  gives the troops below a greater sense of confidence. And seeing the troops below gives the pilots a greater sense of assurance that they will be able to help if needed. But given the thick cloud cover and the mountainous terrain that night in Afghanistan  the only way either knew the other was there was through the occasional radio contact they kept. Without a line of sight  Johnny Bravo couldn't see what the troops saw  but he could sense how the troops felt from what he heard over the radio. And this was enough to spur him to act.Following his gut  Johnny Bravo decided he needed to execute a weather letdown  to drop down below the clouds so he could take a look at what was happening on the ground. It was a daring move. With the thick  low-hanging clouds  scattered storms in the area and the fact that Johnny Bravo would have to fly into a valley with his field of vision reduced by the night-vision goggles  performing the weather letdown under these conditions was extremely treacherous for even the most experienced of pilots.Johnny Bravo was not told to perform the risky maneuver. If anything  he probably would have been told to hang tight and wait until he got the call to help. But Johnny Bravo is not like most pilots. Even though he was thousands of feet above in the safe cocoon of his cockpit  he could sense the anxiety of the men below. Regardless of the dangers  he knew that performing the weather letdown was the right thing to do. And for Johnny Bravo  that meant there was no other choice.Then  just as he was preparing to head down through the clouds into the valley  his instincts were confirmed. Three words came across the radio. Three little words that can send shivers down a pilot's neck: ""Troops in contact.""""Troops in contact"" means someone on the ground is in trouble. It is the call that ground forces use to let others know they are under attack. Though Johnny Bravo had heard those words many times before during training  it was on this night  August 16  2002  that he heard the words ""troops in contact"" for the first time in a combat situation.Johnny Bravo had developed a way to help him relate to the men on the ground. To feel what they feel. During every training exercise  while flying above the battlefield  he would always replay in his mind the scene from the movie Saving Private Ryan when the Allies stormed the beaches of Normandy. He would picture the ramp of a Higgins boat dropping down  the men running onto the beach into a wall of German gunfire. The bullets whizzing past them. The pings of stray shots hitting the steel hulls of the boats. The cries of men hit. Johnny Bravo had trained himself to imagine that that was the scene playing out below every time he heard ""Troops in contact."" With those images vividly embossed in his mind  Johnny Bravo reacted to the call for assistance.He told his wingman to hang tight above the clouds  announced his intentions to the flight controllers and the troops below and pointed his aircraft down into the darkness. As he passed through the clouds  the turbulence thrashed him and his aircraft about. A hard push to the left. A sudden drop. A jolt to the right. Unlike the commercial jets in which we fly  the A-10 is not designed for passenger comfort  and his plane bounced and shook hard as he passed through the layer of cloud.Flying into the unknown with no idea what to expect  Johnny Bravo focused his attention on his instruments  trying to take in as much information as he could. His eyes moved from one dial to the next followed by a quick glance out the front window. Altitude  speed  heading  window. Altitude  speed  heading  window. ""Please. Let. This. Work. Please. Let. This. Work "" he said to himself under his breath.When he finally broke through the clouds  he was less than a thousand feet off the ground  flying in a valley. The sight that greeted him was nothing like he had ever seen before  not in training or in the movies. There was enemy fire coming from both sides of the valley. Massive amounts of it. There was so much that the tracer fire-the streaks of light that follow the bullets-lit up the whole area. Bullets and rockets all aimed at the middle  all aimed squarely at the Special Operations Forces pinned down below.In 2002 the avionics in the aircraft were not as sophisticated as they are today. The instruments Johnny Bravo had couldn't prevent him from hitting the mountain walls. Worse  he was flying with old Soviet maps left over from the invasion of Afghanistan in the 1980s. But there was no way he was going to let down those troops. ""There are fates worse than death "" he will tell you. ""One fate worse than death is accidentally killing your own men. Another fate worse than death is going home alive when twenty-two others don't.""And so  on that dark night in August  Johnny Bravo started counting. He knew his speed and he knew his distance from the mountains. He did some quick calculations in his head and counted out loud the seconds he had before he would hit the valley walls. ""One one thousand  two one thousand  three one thousand . . ."" He locked his guns onto a position from which he could see a lot of enemy fire originating and held down the trigger of his Gatling gun. ""Four one thousand  five one thousand  six one thousand . . ."" At the point he ran out of room  he pulled back on the stick and pulled a sharp turn. His plane roared as he pulled back into the cloud above  his only option to avoid smacking into the mountain. His body pressed hard into his seat from the pressure of the G-forces as he set to go around again. But there was no sound on the radio. The silence was deafening. Did the radio silence mean his shots were useless? Did it mean the guy on the radio was down? Or worse  did it mean the whole team was down?Then the call came. ""Good hits! Good hits! Keep it coming!"" And keep it coming he did. He took another pass  counting again to avoid hitting the mountains. ""One one thousand  two one thousand  three one thousand . . ."" And another sharp turn and another run. And another. And another. He was making good hits and he had plenty of fuel  the problem now was  he was out of ammo.He pointed his plane up to the clouds to fly and meet his wingman  who was still circling above. Johnny Bravo quickly briefed his partner on the situation and told him to do one thing  ""Follow me."" The two A-10s  flying three feet apart from each other  wing to wing  disappeared together into the clouds.When they popped out  both less than a thousand feet above the ground  they began their runs together. Johnny Bravo did the counting and his wingman followed his lead and laid down the fire. ""One one thousand. Two one thousand. Three one thousand. Four one thousand . . ."" On cue  the two planes pulled high-G turns together and went around again and again and again. ""One one thousand. Two one thousand. Three one thousand. Four one thousand.""That night  twenty-two men went home alive. There were no American casualties.The Value of EmpathyThat August night over Afghanistan  Johnny Bravo risked his life so that others might survive. He received no performance bonus. He didn't get a promotion or an award at the company off-site. He wasn't looking for any undue attention or reality TV show for his efforts. For Johnny Bravo  it was just part of the ""J.O.B."" as he puts it. And the greatest reward he received for his service was meeting the forces for whom he provided top cover that night. Though they had never met before  when they finally did meet  they hugged like old friends.In the linear hierarchies in which we work  we want the folks at the top to see what we did. We raise our hands for recognition and reward. For most of us  the more recognition we get for our efforts from those in charge  the more successful we think we are. It is a system that works so long as that one person who supervises us stays at the company and feels no undue pressure from above-a nearly impossible standard to maintain. For Johnny Bravo and those like him  the will to succeed and the desire to do things that advance the interests of the organization aren't just motivated by recognition from above  they are integral to a culture of sacrifice and service  in which protection comes from all levels of the organization.There is one thing that Johnny Bravo credits for giving him the courage to cross into the darkness of the unknown  sometimes with the knowledge that he might not come back. And it's not necessarily what you would expect. As valuable as it was  it isn't his training. And for all the advanced schooling he has received  it isn't his education. And as remarkable as the tools are that he has been given  it isn't his aircraft or any of its sophisticated systems. For all the technology he has at his disposal  empathy  Johnny Bravo says  is the single greatest asset he has to do his job. Ask any of the remarkable men and women in uniform who risk themselves for the benefit of others why they do it and they will tell you the same thing: ""Because they would have done it for me.""Where do people like Johnny Bravo come from? Are they just born that way? Some perhaps are. But if the conditions in which we work meet a particular standard  every single one of us is capable of the courage and sacrifice of a Johnny Bravo. Though we may not be asked to risk our lives or to save anybody else's  we would gladly share our glory and help those with whom we work succeed. More important  in the right conditions  the people with whom we work would choose to do those things for us. And when that happens  when those kinds of bonds are formed  a strong foundation is laid for the kind of success and fulfillment that no amount of money  fame or awards can buy. This is what it means to work in a place in which the leaders prioritize the well-being of their people and  in return  their people give everything they've got to protect and advance the well-being of one another and the organization.I use the military to illustrate the example because the lessons are so much more exaggerated when it is a matter of life and death. There is a pattern that exists in the organizations that achieve the greatest success  the ones that outmaneuver and outinnovate their competitors  the ones that command the greatest respect from inside and outside their organizations  the ones with the highest loyalty and lowest churn and the ability to weather nearly every storm or challenge. These exceptional organizations all have cultures in which the leaders provide cover from above and the people on the ground look out for each other. This is the reason they are willing to push hard and take the kinds of risks they do. And the way any organization can achieve this is with empathy.Chapter 2Employees Are People TooBefore there was empathy at the company  going to work felt like  well  work. On any given morning  the factory employees would stand at their machines waiting to start at the sound of the bell. And when it rang  on cue they would flip the switches and power up the machines in front of them. Within a few seconds  the whir of the machinery drowned out the sound of their voices. The workday had begun.About two hours into the day  another bell would ring  announcing the time the workers could take a break. The machines would stop and nearly every worker would leave their post. Some went to the bathroom. Some went to grab another cup of coffee. And some just sat by their machines  resting until the bell told them to start work again. A few hours later  the bell would sound again  this time to let them know they were now allowed to leave the building for lunch. This was the way it had always been done."

The Conference of the Birds (Penguin Classics) Amazon.com Review Like Rumi and Hafiz  the name Attar conjures up images of passionate attraction to the divine. Attar was a Persian Sufi of the 12th century and his masterpiece is The Conference of the Birds  an epic allegory of the seeker's journey to God. When all the birds of the world convene and determine that they lack a king  one bird steps forward and offers to lead them to a great and mighty monarch. Initially excited  each bird falters in turn  whereupon the leader admonishes them with well-targeted parables. These pithy tales are the delight of this 4 500-line poem  translated deftly into rhymed couplets. What is your excuse for not seeking God? Your life is fine already? You prefer material pleasure? You are holy enough? You have pride  lack courage  or are burdened with responsibility? Attar has an answer to encourage you on the path to the promised land. And when you get there  the king may not be what you'd expect  but you must make the journey to see. --Brian Bruya  Review “This felicitous translation is a classic and reaches the widest possible audience.” — David Azzolina  Assistant Professor  University of Pennsylvania               See all Product description
Theory of Wing Sections (Dover Books on Aeronautical Engineering) 
"Death by Medicine Review America's medical system has not only lost its way but has become the leading cause of death and injury in the United States. That shocking assertion is the premise of this compact but explosive book by Gary Null  an award-winning journalist  public radio host  author of wellness books  and strong proponent of alternative medicine and natural healing. Null believes the medical field is in serious need of repair  big corporations and the deep-pocketed pharmaceutical industry have effectively hamstrung government agencies and subjugated much of the medical community through threats and financial incentives. The end result? Not only are people not getting the proper care they deserve  they are dying. In a systematic presentation  the author addresses the plague of needless surgical blunders  negative side effects of corporate drugs  frivolous operations  shameful neglect of the elderly warehoused in rest homes  and research universities' growing dependency on grant money from big business. All of this is done at the expense of preventive forms of healing. Effective  alternative  and traditional types of care are left out of the loop of money and influence. ""Many complementary healthcare providers are denied publication through the intervention of pharmaceutical companies "" Null writes. ""If they or their allopathic colleagues do manage to speak out against corruption in the establishment  they are considered traitors to the medical brotherhood."" The author makes effective use of headline-grabbing statistics and shocking anecdotal evidence from a wide range of medical sources  including the Journal of the American Medical Association and numerous researchers of note. References and an index are included. The reader learns that 45 million unnecessary and/or inappropriate antibiotics are prescribed annually. About 8.9 million patients are unnecessarily hospitalized each year. Tons of unused drugs are regularly dumped into the water supply  polluting drinking sources. This book is presented as an exposé  as the title suggests  to reveal cracks in the medical institutions that are killing people. The book is meant to outrage  warn  and light a fire under a citizenry the author hopes will demand reform. Do not look for balance  though. This book does not offer the voices of opposing sides of the argument. Refutations from representatives of ""big pharma"" won't be found. The author wanted this vehicle to drive home his message. And it certainly does. (January) Karl Kunkel --Foreword Magazine""...Anyone with a horse in the health care race is sure to be intrigued and provoked."" --Publishers Weekly"

Dreams (Vintage Mini) (Vintage Minis) About the Author Sigmund Freud (1856-1939) was born in Moravia  between the ages of four and eighty-two his home was in Vienna: in 1938 Hitler's invasion of Austria forced him to seek asylum in London  where he died in the following year. His career began with several years of brilliant work on the anatomy and physiology of the nervous system.

"The Oxford India Gandhi: Essential Writings (Oxford India Collection) Review 'The fascination of the book is that it reads like an informal biography with the voice of the subject intervening. ... Gopal Gandhi's focus is  in effect  his own understanding of his grandfather and is therefore different from other biographers. There are striking and occasionally startlingly candid pointers to why Gandhi took certain decisions or acted in a particular way both in private and public matters.' (-ROMILA THAPAR)'On many points there would doubtless be room for one to disagree with Gandhiji  and one merit of Shri Gopalkrishna's selection is that he does not brush under the carpet what one could still (respectfully) hold to be the eccentricities of a very great man.' (-IRFAN HABIB) 				    	 					 About the Author Gopalkrishna Gandhi is a former administrator and diplomat."
"ILLUS PRINCIPLES POOL BILLIARDS From Booklist If you think the best pool players are leather-jacketed badasses who quit school at 12 to shark sailors out of their paychecks  think again. Pool involves complex physical principles that aren't taught until long after the delinquents have departed the academy. ""Dr. Dave "" both a professor of mechanical engineering and a Billiards Digest columnist  has written a textbook-style how-to that focuses on the game's fundamental principles. It's loaded with excellent color diagrams  decent photographs  and useful sidebars. He's a Web geek  too--there are dozens of cross-references to his site  where free videos demonstrate the lessons on the page. (The site even offers technical proofs!) There's so much information packed in here that learners who prefer a prosy approach may be put off. It's written clearly  though  and for the nuts-and-bolts crowd--make that the graphing-calculator and circuit-board set--it's hard to imagine a better primer. Reminiscent of Jack Koehler's excellent The Science of Pocket Billiards (1989). Pool is for nerds--and that's cool. Keir GraffCopyright © American Library Association. All rights reserved"

"Archaeology: A Very Short Introduction (Very Short Introductions) Review Review from previous edition Very lively indeed and remarkably perceptive - a quite brilliant and level-headed look at the curious world of archaeology. (Barry Cunliffe  University of Oxford)It is often said that well-written books are rare in archaeology  but this is a model of good writing for a general audience. [The] chapters rattle along  packed with information by never getting bogged down in too much details. The book is full of jokes  but its serious message-that archaeology can be a rich and fascinating subject-it gets across with more panache than any other book I know.

Madgic gives a brief history of its early climbers  then tells the story of five hikers who began their climb on the evening of July 27  1985  in the face of an imminent thunderstorm. One of three groups of climbers that day  it was headed by Adrian Esteban and Tom Rice. They planned to backpack to the top  camp there  and celebrate Rice's birthday the next day.

"Interpretation of Dreams  The Amazon.com Review Whether we love or hate Sigmund Freud  we all have to admit that he revolutionized the way we think about ourselves. Much of this revolution can be traced to The Interpretation of Dreams  the turn-of-the-century tour de force that outlined his theory of unconscious forces in the context of dream analysis. Introducing the id  the superego  and their problem child  the ego  Freud advanced scientific understanding of the mind immeasurably by exposing motivations normally invisible to our consciousness. While there's no question that his own biases and neuroses influenced his observations  the details are less important than the paradigm shift as a whole. After Freud  our interior lives became richer and vastly more mysterious. These mysteries clearly bothered him--he went to great (often absurd) lengths to explain dream imagery in terms of childhood sexual trauma  a component of his theory jettisoned mid-century  though now popular among recovered-memory therapists. His dispassionate analyses of his own dreams are excellent studies for cognitive scientists wishing to learn how to sacrifice their vanities for the cause of learning. Freud said of the work contained in The Interpretation of Dreams  ""Insight such as this falls to one's lot but once in a lifetime."" One would have to feel quite fortunate to shake the world even once. --Rob Lightner  Review “The groundbreaking masterwork that launched psychoanalysis” (Time magazine)“Freud’s classic.

"Hunger: A Memoir of (My) Body Review I have reviewed many interesting books for the TLS this year  but the most moving is Roxane Gay's Hunger . . .  Her survivor's story is both understated and inspiring.I'm very thankful for Roxane Gay's Hunger  which should be and should have been on every award list if people were really reading. This is her best book  in my opinion. I love that it takes an unconventional road to storytelling and that the structure often spirals within itself in interesting ways. I also love that it is a story about sexual assault and the ways in which that can change your life. It's a deeply moving  somewhat experimental  gorgeously written and brilliantly thought-out memoir. And it's one of those books that no matter what your relationship to the body  this book is for you  all of you.This whip-smart book takes on everythingIn 88 short  lucid chapters  Gay powerfully takes readers through realities that pain her  vex her  guide her  and inform her work. The result is a generous and empathic consideration of what it's like to be someone else: in itself something of a miracle.It turns out that when a wrenching past is confronted with wisdom and bravery  the outcome can be compassion and enlightenment - both for the reader who has lived through this kind of unimaginable pain  and for the reader who knows nothing of it. Roxane Gay shows us how to be decent to ourselves  and decent to one another. HUNGER is an amazing achievement in more ways than I can count.A heart-rending debut memoir from the outspoken feminist and essayist . . . An intense  unsparingly honest portrait of childhood crisis and its enduring aftermath.

"The Origin of Species (Bantam Classic) Amazon.com Review It's hard to talk about The Origin of Species without making statements that seem overwrought and fulsome. But it's true: this is indeed one of the most important and influential books ever written  and it is one of the very few groundbreaking works of science that is truly readable. To a certain extent it suffers from the Hamlet problem--it's full of clichés! Or what are now clichés  but which Darwin was the first to pen. Natural selection  variation  the struggle for existence  survival of the fittest: it's all in here. Darwin's friend and ""bulldog"" T.H. Huxley said upon reading the Origin  ""How extremely stupid of me not to have thought of that."" Alfred Russel Wallace had thought of the same theory of evolution Darwin did  but it was Darwin who gathered the mass of supporting evidence--on domestic animals and plants  on variability  on sexual selection  on dispersal--that swept most scientists before it. It's hardly necessary to mention that the book is still controversial: Darwin's remark in his conclusion that ""Light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history"" is surely the pinnacle of British understatement. --Mary Ellen Curtin  From the Inside Flap Perhaps the most readable and accessible of the great works of scientific imagination  The Origin of Species sold out on the day it was published in 1859. Theologians quickly labeled Charles Darwin the most dangerous man in England  and  as the Saturday Review noted  the uproar over the book quickly ""passed beyond the bounds of the study and lecture-room into the drawing-room and the public street."" Yet  after reading it  Darwin's friend and colleague T. H. Huxley had a different reaction: ""How extremely stupid not to have thought of that.""Based largely on Darwin's experience as a naturalist while on a five-year voyage aboard H.M.S. Beagle  The Origin of Species set forth a theory of evolution and natural selection that challenged contemporary beliefs about divine providence and the immutability of species. A landmark contribution to philosophical and scientific thought  this edition also includes an introductory historical sketch and a glossary Darwin later added to the original text. Charles Darwin grew up considered  by his own account  ""a very ordinary boy  rather below the common standard of intellect."" A quirk of fate kept him from the career his father had deemed appropriate--that of a country parson--when a botanist recommended Darwin for an appointment as a naturalist aboard H.M.S. Beagle from 1831 to 1836. Darwin is also the author of the five-volume work Zoology of the Voyage of the Beagle (1839) and The Descent of Man (1871).

CHAPTER 1Your Home Is  an Investment Property“Land is the only thing in the world that amounts to anything . . . for ’tis the only thing in this world that lasts. . . . ’Tis the onlything worth working for  worth fighting for—worth dying for.”—Margaret MitchellYour home is a lot of things  most of them good. Your home is your castle  your refuge  your escape. It may be the physical manifestation of all your material hopes and aspirations  your piece of the American dream. It gives comfort and protection to you and your family. It may be an essential part of your retirement or college-savings plans. Your home is probably your biggest asset  and the price you could ask for it today is almost certainly higher than the price you paid for it back whenever.But your home is not an investment property.Investing in real estate isn’t the same as owning a house. If you don’t get anything else out of this book  you need to understand that—especially now that so many homeowners are trying to play the real-estate game with their homes. That’s dangerous—not because the value of your home is likely to decline (though it could)  but because you are more likely to spend far more money living in your home than you will make when you sell it.Investing is investing. It’s using your money to make more money. Anything else  including most home purchases  is spending.To be considered investments  real-estate purchases must generate actual profits  either immediately in the form of income or long-term in the form of appreciation. In either case  the property must cover all its own costs and produce a reasonable return on the money you spent to buy it.You will read and hear other terms for measuring investment income—rate of return  “cap rate ” net operating income  rental roll. Each is different  but one way or another  they all come down to the most basic concept of real-estate investing: “cash flow”—real in-your-pocket-put-it-in-the-bank money that’s left over after you have covered all your business expenses. That’s something you don’t get when you just own a home. Yes  your house is a huge asset. But without cash flow  you might as well be holding on to a very big  very expensive Beanie Baby.You are thinking I’m nuts. You’re saying  “I bought my house in 1990 for $200 000. I put in a thousand-square foot addition  including a new bathroom. I redid the old bathroom and put in a new kitchen and a deck with a hot tub. I could get $650 000 for it today.”That sure sounds like an investment. But if you run the numbers  you will see that it’s not much of an investment at all. How would you feel about a stock that cost you more to own than you make when you sell it?Take a look at this spreadsheet  which represents 16 years of ownership of a house in the Los Angeles area. We’re sticking to simple concepts and round numbers here. But with a few assumptions—including the improvements  regular maintenance and a couple of big ticket repairs such as a paint job and a new roof—this typical homeowner actually loses more than $5 000 a year  even as the house “appreciates” at a steady and optimistic 5 percent annually. Put simply: At the end of the 17 years of ownership  this home seller will have spent $415 000 in order to pocket $328 000—a loss of $86 000.How is that possible? When homeowners compute their returns  they rarely consider all the costs of owning a property. Generally  they don’t do much more than subtract their down payment—$40 000 in this case—from the proceeds of the sale ($328 000) and declare they made a huge “profit” ($288 000).But it doesn’t really work that way. There are big problems with this typical homeowner’s investment plan.Homeowners rarely consider maintenance or the declining value of improvements. Painting  roof repairs or new furnaces don’t pay for themselves  and remodeling is a huge loser. Entire industries have arisen to entice homeowners to spend thousands of dollars for new kitchen cabinets  granite countertops and stainless-steel appliances or his-and-hers master suite bathroom spas featuring multihead showers and Asian-inspired “soaking” tubs. Architects  builders  magazine editors and real-estate agents tout such improvements as if typical homeowners absolutely must take the remodeling plunge or forever risk the value of the house and suffer the ridicule of friends and neighbors.Remodeling magazine publishes a widely quoted annual survey of the value of home improvements. In 2005  the magazine said that an upscale kitchen remodel like you see in the glossy shelter magazines would cost $82 000 and would return just 84 percent four years later. Absurd. This kind of project might get raves from your friends  but it’s a fool’s financial play. A new kitchen is certainly a nice thing to have  but it’s not an investment that’s going to make you any money. That 84 percent return means the homeowner will lose more than $3 000 a year on the kitchen. And if the owner borrows the money to remodel the kitchen—which most do—the losses could quickly triple.That’s because long-term borrowing is the home investor’s nemesis. How ironic. The 30-year mortgage—which greatly reduced monthly payments and put home ownership within the grasp of nearly 70 percent of American households—locked those same households into Grand Canyons of debt. Mortgage interest  even after the government’s mortgage-interest tax-deduction subsidy  is the homeowner’s overwhelmingly largest expense  and it drives up the cost of a house so much that a true profit is all but impossible for most owners. In this scenario  the homeowners spent about $234 000 of after-tax money on interest—more than half the total appreciation—over the 16 years. And most Americans move after just 5 to 7 years!Adding further insult: You can’t spend a home—or even a new kitchen. No matter that the increased value of the house is pushing up the owners’ net worth—they can only borrow against their house or sell it. If they borrow  they are digging themselves another debt hole. In order to make the debt worth taking on  they’d have to forgo the new kitchen and invest the proceeds of the loan in something that will return more than it costs to pay the interest and the principal. Just to break even  then  the homeowner who borrows for 30 years at 6.5 percent would need to invest that $82 000 in something that would return at least $6 200 a year. As you will learn from this book  a good place to invest might be a rental property. But certainly not in a new kitchen.And if homeowners do choose to sell  they will still have to find a place to live. When home prices rise  they rise in the entire area. So if the homeowners stay in the same metropolitan region  they will most likely have to move to a much smaller house or to a less-desirable neighborhood or take out another mortgage and restart the debt clock.Even if they move to a cheaper housing market (and just about any place is cheaper than the Los Angeles area)  they are likely to spend most or all of their cash on their new house. Again  the return is pretty much an illusion. That $328 000 will buy a very nice place in Las Vegas  Phoenix  Boise or some of the other cities of the West overflowing with former Californians. But at what real cost?Now in their 50s or 60s and living mortgage free  these Equity Ex-Pats will be leaving their heirs some property. But as investors  they have been net losers. In this example  they will have paid nearly $750 000 to buy that new house—you have to add the $415 000 they spent on the first house to get the $328 000 they paid for the new house. And they must still pay and keep paying to maintain the new house and to cover taxes and insurance.To be fair  homeowners have to live somewhere  and they have to pay rent to someone. So they may as well buy and pay “deductible” rent in the form of a mortgage payment. After all  the government does cover a quarter to one-third of mortgage interest through the home-mortgage-interest tax deduction. No renter gets that kind of break. And a homeowner gets the added benefit of enforced savings in that he is paying some principal and the property is appreciating over time.That’s all true  and the “imputed rent” (money that would have been spent on rent but wasn’t) that comes from paying for a house with a long-term mortgage is the number one cost savings for homeowners. In this example  a renter living in the same house over the same 16 years could easily pay monthly rents totaling $600 000. In that sense  the homeowner sees a sizable “profit” even as he or she loses thousands of dollars a year on the primary investment. Of course  from a financial perspective  it’s not really a profit at all. It’s just money that the homeowner did not spend  just as you don’t make a $50 000 profit when you choose to buy a $30 000 Buick instead of an $80 000 Mercedes-Benz.Now if someone feels it’s worth more than a half-million dollars to live in this house  who are you to disagree? I’m sure you’ll agree as well that it’s far better to be receiving that money than to be paying it. So let’s look at the same house from a landlord’s perspective.Take a look at this next spreadsheet.As you can see  even with increasing the annual costs and computing the mortgage interest before  not after  taxes  a landlord makes a handsome profit on the same property that was a financial drain on a homeowner.The “Profit/(Loss)” column shows how much money the landlord has after paying all his pretax expenses. A nasty negative cash flow in the first year was quickly converted to profits in later years  and the landlord was in the black after just two years. By the last year  the homeowner’s money pit had become an ATM handing over more than $2 000 a month to its landlord while actually appreciating at the 5 percent per year rate that the homeowner thought he was getting. (You will see later how the landlord actually does better because of tax laws that favor real-estate investing even more than homeowning.)Let’s take this calculation one step further and put it in terms most people who have a basic familiarity with investing can appreciate. How does this real-estate investment compare with the Dow Jones Industrial Average—the most widely quoted stock-market benchmark?A $40 000 investment in an index fund tracking the Dow from January 1  1990  to June 30  2005—a period when the Dow rose about 273 percent and total return  including stock dividends  was 436 percent—would be worth about $174 400 today  before taxes. So that’s our benchmark. Any investor could have done that. So for the sake of this discussion  let’s say a reasonable criterion for a successful real-estate venture is to beat the Dow.We know what happened to the homeowner: a loss of $86 000. That’s why a home isn’t an investment.But how good of an investment was the house for our Los Angeles landlord? How well did he do? Outstanding. He had an overall pretax return of $403 000—annual rental income and a hefty profit from the sale of the property.That’s almost two and a half times what he could have done in the stock market  and probably enough to buy a very nice place alongside all the other former Californians in Phoenix  Las Vegas or Boise."

"Pachinko Review 'A sweeping  engrossing family saga ... a poignantly told tale. Gracefully written and dotted with memorable images  evocative of the pace and time  it's a page-turning panorama of one family's path through suffering to prosperity in 20th-century Japan' Literary Review. 'A rich  moving novel about exile  identity and the determination to endure' Sunday Times. 'Wonderful  in scope  scale and the beauty of storytelling' Nicola Sturgeon. 'An exquisite  haunting epic ... Lee's profound novel of losses and gains explored through the social and cultural implications of pachinko-parlor owners and users is shaped by impeccable research  meticulous plotting  and empathic perception' Booklist Starred Review. '[A] beautifully crafted story of love  loss determination  luck  and perseverance ... Lee's skilful development of her characters and story lines will draw readers into the work. Those who enjoy historical fiction with strong characterisations will not be disappointed as they ride along on the emotional journeys offered in the author's latest page-turner' Library Journal. 'Love  luck  and talent combine with cruelty and random misfortune in a deeply compelling story  with the troubles of ethnic Koreans living in Japan never far from view. An old-fashioned epic whose simple  captivating storytelling delivers both wisdom and truth' Kirkus. 'A compassionate  clear gaze at the chaotic landscape of life itself. In this haunting epic tale  no one story seems too minor to be briefly illuminated. Lee suggests that behind the facades of wildly different people lie countless private desires  hopes and miseries  if we have the patience and compassion to look and listen' New York Times Book Review. 'Both for those who love Korea  as well as for those who know no more than Hyundai  Samsung and kimchi  this extraordinary book will prove a revelation of joy and heartbreak. I could not stop turning the pages  and wished this most poignant of sagas would never end. Min Jin Lee displays a tenderness and wisdom ideally matched to an unforgettable tale that she relates just perfectly' Simon Winchester  author of Korea: A Walk Through the Land of Miracles. 'Elegant and soulful  both intimate and sweeping. This story of several generations of one Korean family in Japan is the story of every family whose parents sacrificed for their children  every family whose children were unable to recognize the cost  but it's also the story of a specific cultural struggle in a riveting time and place. Min Jin Lee has written a big  beautiful book filled with characters I rooted for and cared about and remembered after I'd read the final page' Kate Christensen  award-winning author of The Great Man and Blue Plate Special. 'Remarkable ... A striking introduction to lives  to a world  [the reader] may never have seen  or even thought to look at. In our increasingly fractured and divisive times  there can be no higher purpose for literature: all in the pages of a book that  once you've started  you'll simply be unable to put down' Harper's Bazaar. 'A long  complex book  it wears its research lightly  and is a page-turner. You can sense the author's love and understanding for all the characters  the good and the flawed' Irish Examiner. 'A great book  a passionate story  a novel of magisterial sweep. It's also fiendishly readable - the real deal. An instant classic  a quick page-turner  and probably the best book of the year' Darin Strauss  New York Times-bestselling author of Chang and Eng. 'An epic  multi-generational saga' Mail on Sunday  Best of 2017. 'We never feel history being spoon-fed to us: it is wholly absorbed into character and story  which is no mean feat for a novel covering almost a century of history' Financial Times. 'The work of a writer in complete control of her characters and her story and with an intense awareness of the importance of her heritage ... Told with such flair and linguistic dexterity that I found myself unable to put it down. Every year  there are a few standout novels that survive long past the hype has died down and the hyperbolic compliments from friends scattered across the dust jacket have been forgotten. Pachinko  a masterpiece of empathy  integrity and familial loyalty  will be one of those novels' John Boyne  Irish Times. 'Gripping ... a stunning achievement  full of heart  full of grace  full of truth' Erica Wagner. 'A long novel  but it never feels it - Min Jin Lee's storytelling is effortless' Stylist  Pick of the best new books for 2017. 'Luminous ... a powerful meditation on what immigrants sacrifice to achieve a home in the world' Junot Diaz. 'A deep  broad  addictive history of a Korean family in Japan enduring and prospering through the 20th century' David Mitchell  Guardian. 'Stunning ... Pachinko is about outsiders  minorities and the politically disenfranchised. But it is so much more besides. Each time the novel seems to find its locus - Japan's colonization of Korea  World War II as experienced in East Asia  Christianity  family  love  the changing role of women - it becomes something else. It becomes even more than it was' New York Times. 				    	 					 About the Author Min Jin Lee is an author and journalist. Her debut novel  Free Food for Millionaires  was named as one of the 'Top 10 Novels of the Year' by the Times and USA Today.

By turns alarming  sad and funny  [the] book provides a harrowing look  through the prism of Mr. Noah's family  at life in South Africa under apartheid and the country's lurching entry into a postapartheid era in the 1990s."" —The New York Times ""[A] stirring memoir. . . . Noah proves to be a gifted storyteller  able to deftly lace his poignant tales with amusing irony."" —Entertainment Weekly ""Born a Crime is an engaging  fast-paced and vivid read. . . . The book is essential reading not only because it is a personal story of survival  leavened with insight and wit  but because it does more to expose apartheid—its legacy  its pettiness  its small-minded stupidity and its damage—than any other recent history book or academic text."" —The Guardian (UK)""[A] substantial collection of staggering personal essays. . . . Incisive  funny and vivid  these true tales are anchored to his portrait of his courageous  rebellious and religious mother who defied racially restrictive laws to secure an education and a career for herself—and to have a child with a white Swiss/German even though sex between whites and blacks was illegal. . . . [Trevor Noah's] electrifying memoir sparkles with funny stories . . . and his candid and compassionate essays deepen our perception of the complexities of race  gender and class."" —Booklist  starred review ""A gritty memoir . . . studded with insight and provocative social criticism . . . with flashes of brilliant storytelling and acute observations."" —Kirkus Reviews""[Noah's] story of surviving—and thriving—is mind-blowing."" —Cosmopolitan""Noah's memoir is extraordinary in its observations of South Africa in the years when apartheid crumbled. It's equally unusual in the troubling personal story it tells. Throw in Noah's sharp  droll prose style  and you have a book that feels like essential reading on every level."" —The Seattle Times ""What makes Born a Crime such a soul-nourishing pleasure  even with all its darker edges and perilous turns  is reading Noah recount in brisk  warmly conversational prose how he learned to negotiate his way through the bullying and ostracism. . . . What also helped was having a mother like Patricia Nombuyiselo Noah. . . . Consider Born a Crime another such gift to her—and an enormous gift to the rest of us."" —USA Today""You'd be hard-pressed to find a comic's origin story better than the one Trevor Noah serves up in Born a Crime."" —O: The Oprah Magazine""Witty and revealing . . . Noah's story is the story of modern South Africa  though he enjoyed some privileges of the region's slow Westernization  his formative years were shaped by poverty  injustice and violence. Noah is quick with a disarming joke  and he skillfully integrates the parallel narratives via interstitial asides between chapters. . . . Perhaps the most harrowing tales are those of his abusive stepfather  which form the book's final act (and which Noah cleverly foreshadows throughout earlier chapters)  but equally prominent are the laugh-out-loud yarns about going to the prom and the differences between 'White Church' and 'Black Church.'"" —Publishers Weekly  starred review""[Noah] thrives with the help of his astonishingly fearless mother. . . . Their fierce bond makes this story soar."" —People""Extraordinarily heartfelt  compulsively enriching . . . a hell of a memoir. . . .

"That Churchill Woman: A Novel Review “The perfect confection of a novel . . . We’re introduced to Jennie in all of her passion and keen intelligence and beauty. While she is surrounded by a cast of late-Victorian celebrities  including Bertie  Prince of Wales  it’s always Jennie who shines and takes the center stage she was born to.”—Melanie Benjamin  New York Times bestselling author of The Aviator’s Wife and The Swans of Fifth Avenue   “Stephanie Barron cuts through the scandal and rumors surrounding Lady Randolph Churchill to bring us the woman herself in all her complexity: caught between worlds as an American in England  an intimate of princes  a favorite target of the scandal sheets  yet intensely private and fiercely loyal. Barron brings us along with Jennie to a world seething with secrets behind a façade of intricate etiquette and elaborate gowns. . . . An immense accomplishment from a seasoned author.”—Lauren Willig  New York Times bestselling author of the Pink Carnation series   “What a subject for a novel! And what a read for anyone interested in the lives of women who have  until now  been largely unexplored. Barron’s immersive and richly detailed story gives a fascinating glimpse into the lives of society women  as well as the early life of Winston Churchill himself.”—Jane Thynne  author of the Clara Vine series   “Finely researched  sumptuous . . . Presenting a fiercely intelligent  independent version of Jennie  this satisfying book actively pushes back against her historical reputation as a scandalous woman to great  consuming effect.”—Publishers Weekly   “Barron paints a picture of a beautiful woman with enough determination and animal magnetism to get what she wants. . . . The characters are captivating.”—Kirkus Reviews  About the Author Stephanie Barron studied history at Princeton and Stanford  where she was an Andrew W. Mellon Foundation Fellow in the Humanities. She is the author of the historical suspense novels A Flaw in the Blood and The White Garden  as well as the critically acclaimed and nationally bestselling Jane Austen Mystery series. A former intelligence analyst for the CIA  Barron—who also writes under the name Francine Mathews—drew on her experience in espionage for such novels as Jack 1939  which The New Yorker described as “one of the most deliciously high-concept thrillers imaginable.” She lives and works in Denver  Colorado.

1962: The War That Wasn't Review  …Verma's book is one of the few comprehensive accounts pieced together to give the total picture—not only of the battlescape  but also the political space. –Week 1962: The War That Wasn’t by Shiv Kunal Verma is a courageous book that…will become a benchmark for the genre of military writing in India. —Sunday Guardian   Verma's meticulous detail of the battle lines is understandable for it honours the brave and the fallen…. the story is gripping and monumentally tragic.—Telegraph   …an immaculately-researched and carefully structured study that will be of interest to all Indians  and not just military history buffs. More importantly  it is likely to stand the test of time  which is the ultimate criterion for all historical treatises.—Financial Times   Shiv Kunal Verma has written [a] very detailed and highly readable account…takes us step by step through the events that led up to the conflict… Verma’s book stands out as one of the most objective and authoritative accounts… —Biblio   Riveting in both style and substance  this book chronicles the story of an army that was let down by some of its senior officers…as well as their political masters. The book also documents the early history of the regions…and the goings-on in the Indian Army  including political meddling…— Indian Link   Three decades in the making  1962: The War  That Wasn’t is a labour of love  sans the rhetoric and rose-tinted sunglasses. Incredibly well researched  the book dispassionately examines events and circumstances that finally culminated with the month long hostilities in the Himalayas.—Swarajya
The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business Review “Sharp  provocative  and useful.”—Jim Collins“Few [books] become essential manuals for business and living. The Power of Habit is an exception. Charles Duhigg not only explains how habits are formed but how to kick bad ones and hang on to the good.”—Financial Times “Entertaining . . . enjoyable . . . fascinating . . . a serious look at the science of habit formation and change.”—The New York Times Book Review “Cue: see cover. Routine: read book. Reward: fully comprehend the art of manipulation.”—Bloomberg Businessweek“A fresh examination of how routine behaviors take hold and whether they are susceptible to change . . . The stories that Duhigg has knitted together are all fascinating in their own right  but take on an added dimension when wedded to his examination of habits.”— Associated Press “There’s been a lot of research over the past several years about how our habits shape us  and this work is beautifully described in the new book The Power of Habit.”—David Brooks  The New York Times “A first-rate book—based on an impressive mass of research  written in a lively style and providing just the right balance of intellectual seriousness with practical advice on how to break our bad habits.”—The Economist “I have been spinning like a top since reading The Power of Habit  New York Times journalist Charles Duhigg’s fascinating best-seller about how people  businesses and organizations develop the positive routines that make them productive—and happy.”—The Washington Post “An absolutely fascinating . . . book [that explores] a startling and sometimes dismaying collision between the increasingly sophisticated scientific understanding of habits—how they’re formed  how they can be disrupted and changed—and  among other things  companies’ efforts to use that knowledge to steer your habits and money their way.”—Wired “If Duhigg is right about the nature of habits  which I think he is  then trying to get rid of these bad habits won’t work. Instead  what is needed is to teach the managers to identify the cues that lead to these bad habits and rewards  and then learn alternative routines that lead to similar rewards  i.e. business and personal success.”—Forbes “The Power of Habit is chock-full of fascinating anecdotes . . . how an early twentieth century adman turned Pepsodent into the first bestselling toothpaste by creating the habit of brushing daily  how a team of marketing mavens at Procter & Gamble rescued Febreze from the scrapheap of failed products by recognizing that a fresh smell was a fine reward for a cleaning task  how Michael Phelps’ coach instilled habits that made him an Olympic champion many times over  and how Tony Dungy turned the Indianapolis Colts into a Super Bowl–winning team.”—Los Angeles Times  About the Author CHARLES DUHIGG is an investigative reporter for The New York Times. He is a winner of the George Polk and National Academies of Science awards  and was part of a team of finalists for the 2009 Pulitzer Prize.

The Gallery It is said sometimes that female figure is the most beautiful thing God created. Naturally it is a fascinating subject for all painters. John Fernandes with his extraordinary talent paints figures with ease and confidence. Now-a-days in the art field when a cyclonic storm of 'creativity' and 'freedom of expression' is going on  John stands like a rock  proclaiming that 'Drawing' in itself is an art and drawing and painting a figure is one of the most challenging subject for an artist. John is a draftsman of tremendous ability. His confidence and the power of execution make one feel that God stuck a brush in his hand instead of a sword. He draws and paints so naturally that it looks as if he is just enjoying it - especially when he paints a female figure  bringing all the grace and delicacy of the model. Surely he is an artist who can be called a phenomenon.

McKinley. His name was Christopher Johnson McCandless. He had given $25 000 in savings to charity  abandoned his car and most of his possessions  burned all the cash in his wallet  and invented a new life for himself. Four months later  his decomposed body was found by a moose hunter. How McCandless came to die is the unforgettable story of ""Into the Wild. Immediately after graduating from college in 1991  McCandless had roamed through the West and Southwest on a vision quest like those made by his heroes Jack London and John Muir. In the Mojave Desert he abandoned his car  stripped it of its license plates  and burned all of his cash. He would give himself a new name  Alexander Supertramp  and  unencumbered by money and belongings  he would be free to wallow in the raw  unfiltered experiences that nature presented. Craving a blank spot on the map  McCandless simply threw the maps away. Leaving behind his desperate parents and sister  he vanished into the wild. Jon Krakauer constructs a clarifying prism through which he reassembles the disquieting facts of McCandless's short life. Admitting an interst that borders on obsession  he searches for the clues to the dries and desires that propelled McCandless. Digging deeply  he takes an inherently compelling mystery and unravels the larger riddles it holds: the profound pull of the American wilderness on our imagination  the allure of high-risk activities to young men of a certain cast of mind  the complex  charged bond between fathers and sons. When McCandless's innocent mistakes turn out to be irreversibleand fatal  he becomes the stuff of tabloid headlines and is dismissed for his naivete  pretensions  and hubris. He is said to have had a death wish but wanting to die is a very different thing from being compelled to look over the edge. Krakauer brings McCandless's uncompromising pilgrimage out of the shadows  and the peril  adversity  and renunciation sought by this enigmatic young man are illuminated with a rare understanding--and not an ounce of sentimentality. Mesmerizing  heartbreaking  ""Into the Wild is a ""tour de force. The power and luminosity of Jon Krakauer's stoytelling blaze through every page."

"My PGMEE Notes First of its kind when the book is not written by the senior authors but by the student who is in the race of PGMEE competition.

We came up with an idea during our own preparations to compile the maximum possible important facts and data  along with necessary diagrams  mnemonics and Photographs together at one place in the most concise and simplified way and this idea came into reality by completing this herculean task which ended with a fruit in your hand- "" My PGMEE Notes” In these Notes we are using inclusive target oriented approach based on the new exam patterns that we have experienced in the last few years.

Tucked in a forest in the frozen north  Beartown's residents are tough and hardworking. They don't expect life to be easy  but they do expect it to be fair. Which is why the sudden loss of their hockey players to the rival town of Hed hurts. Everyone needs something to cheer for in the long winter nights. Now they have nothing. So when a new star player arrives  Coach Peter sees an opportunity to rebuild the team - to take on Hed and restore Beartown's fortunes. But not everyone in town sees it his way.As the big game between both towns approaches  the rivalry turns bitter and all too real. Once the stands rumbled with threats to 'kill' and 'ruin' each other  but the residents didn't mean it. Now they do.By the time the last goal is scored  someone in Beartown will be dead . . . Us Against You is the story of two towns  two teams and what it means to believe in something bigger than yourself. It's about how people come together - sometimes in anger  often in sorrow  but also through love. And how  when we stand together  we can bring a town back to life.

"Applied Predictive Modeling Review ""...In teaching a data science course...I use a range of different resources because I need to cover working with data  model evaluation  and machine learning methods. The next time I teach this course  I will use only this book because it covers all of these aspects of the field."" (Louis Luangkesorn  lugerpitt.blogspot.com  June 2015) ""There are a wide variety of books available on predictive analytics and data modeling around the web...we've carefully selected the following 10 books  based on relevance  popularity  online ratings  and their ability to add value to your business. 1. Applied Predictive Modeling."" (Timothy King  Business Intelligence Solutions Review  solutions-review.com  June 2015) ""Applied Predictive Modeling aims to expose many of these techniques in a very readable and self-contained book. This is a very applied and hands-on book. It guides the reader through many examples that serve to illustrate main points  and it raises possible issues and considerations that are oftentimes overlooked or not sufficiently reflected upon. Highly recommended."" (Bojan Tunguz  tunguzreview.com  June 2015) ""This monograph presents a very friendly practical course on prediction techniques for regression and classification models... It is a well-written book very useful to students and practitioners who need an immediate and helpful way to apply complex statistical techniques."" (Stan Lipovetsky  Technometrics  Vol. 56 (3)  August 2014) ""In my judgment  Applied Predictive Modeling by Max Kuhn and Kjell Johnson (Springer 2013) ought to be at the very top of the reading list ...They come across like coaches who really  really want you to be able to do this...Applied Predictive Modeling is a remarkable text...it is the succinct distillation of years of experience of two expert modelers..."" (Joseph Rickert  blog.revolutionanalytics.com  June 2014) 				    	 					 From the Back Cover This text is intended for a broad audience as both an introduction to predictive models as well as a guide to applying them. Non-mathematical readers will appreciate the intuitive explanations of the techniques while an emphasis on problem-solving with real data across a wide variety of applications will aid practitioners who wish to extend their expertise. Readers should have knowledge of basic statistical ideas  such as correlation and linear regression analysis. While the text is biased against complex equations  a mathematical background is needed for advanced topics.Dr. Kuhn is a Director of Non-Clinical Statistics at Pfizer Global R&D in Groton Connecticut. He has been applying predictive models in the pharmaceutical and diagnostic industries for over 15 years and is the author of a number of R packages. Dr. Johnson has more than a decade of statistical consulting and predictive modeling experience in pharmaceutical research and development.  He is a co-founder of Arbor Analytics  a firm specializing in predictive modeling and is a former Director of Statistics at Pfizer Global R&D.  His scholarly work centers on the application and development of statistical methodology and learning algorithms.Applied Predictive Modeling covers the overall predictive modeling process  beginning with the crucial steps of data preprocessing  data splitting and foundations of model tuning.  The text then provides intuitive explanations of numerous common and modern regression and classification techniques  always with an emphasis on illustrating and solving real data problems.  Addressing practical concerns extends beyond model fitting to topics such as handling class imbalance  selecting predictors  and pinpointing causes of poor model performanceall of which are problems that occur frequently in practice. The text illustrates all parts of the modeling process through many hands-on  real-life examples.  And every chapter contains extensive R code for each step of the process.  The data sets and corresponding code are available in the books companion AppliedPredictiveModeling R package  which is freely available on the CRAN archive. This multi-purpose text can be used as an introduction to predictive models and the overall modeling process  a practitioners reference handbook  or as a text for advanced undergraduate or graduate level predictive modeling courses.  To that end  each chapter contains problem sets to help solidify the covered concepts and uses data available in the books R package. Readers and students interested in implementing the methods should have some basic knowledge of R.  And a handful of the more advanced topics require some mathematical knowledge.

"A Little History of Religion (Little Histories) Review ""This is a well-written book  from which most of us will come away knowing more about the religions of the world than we knew before. . . . In its own way this engaging book might be seen as a period piece.""-John Charmley  Times ""Holloway's account is brimful of arresting facts.""-Ian Thomson  Financial Times ""As an informed reflection on the state of faith in the western world in the 21st century  written by someone who has plenty of experience  it is insightful and intelligent.""-Tim Whitmarsh  The Guardian ""Holloway's narrative is made up of many different threads and details carefully woven together to make a satisfying read. The pace is leisurely despite the amount of ground covered  and he manages to include memorable details.""-Carol Palfrey  Sofia ""In an age of religious tension  this is an important contribution to understanding different beliefs. . . . A straightforward  well-written introduction to religion and its various manifestations.""-Library Journal ""Thank God - if I can use that phrase in a neutral way - for Richard Holloway and his carefully weighted  beautifully written and strangely compelling brief history of world religions. . . . There can be no better place to learn about [religion] than in the pages of this enlightening book.""-Peter Stanford  The Observer ""Holloway is a uniquely qualified and respectful guide. He neither preaches nor mocks . . . it's a timely reminder that that  despite our differences  we have more in common than we think.""-Catherine Small  East Anglian Daily Times ""This lovable book is clearly modelled on a best-seller from the same publisher  Gombrich's A Little History of the World. . . .

A Place of Healing: Wrestling with the Mysteries of Suffering  Pain  and God's Sovereignty (Tada Joni Eareckson) From the Back Cover Over four decades ago  a diving accident left Joni Eareckson Tada a quadriplegic. Since that time  she has become a beloved writer and speaker to millions. But today  Joni faces a new battle: chronic  unrelenting pain. As she writes  Just as I said to God years ago when I was first injured  I find myself praying  Lord  I can't live like this for the rest of my life! This ongoing urgency has forced me to look back on familiar scriptures and examine them from new angles. Does God miraculously intervene in the lives of all who pray for release from migraine headaches  multiple sclerosis  cancer--or  in my case  chronic pain?And if not  why not?Here Joni invites you to walk with her through an intense and baffling season of her life. Her words offer not a bundle of ivory-tower theological conclusions but intimate insight from a woman on a journey--a woman who believes in healing from a God who chooses when that healing will come.  About the Author Joni Eareckson Tada is the president of Joni and Friends  an organization accelerating Christian outreach in the disability community. An acclaimed artist and the author of nearly fifty books  Joni lives with her husband in Southern California.

Dance Dance Dance From Booklist There are only a handful of writers in the world who have the ability to thrill like Murakami. Skipping lightly  he has managed to dodge the triple curse of late-twentieth century literary fashion. No political realism  no magic realism  and no postmodernist retooling here. Leaping straight out of the slightly slow-witted but earthy and vigorous head of genre fiction  he has landed on the other side of our age  bypassing altogether the school of elegant repetition and self-conscious significance so admired by the publishing houses of London  New York  and Paris. Employing the flat tone of American writers like Dashiell Hammet and Raymond Carver and peppering his narratives with allusions to the plastic and materialistic world around him  Murakami yet manages to spin fantastic and surprisingly spiritual yarns as odd and riveting--though a good deal more uplifting--as the paintings of Hieronymous Bosch. As in almost all his other works  the protagonist of Dance is an ordinary guy  a reluctant but curious participant in events revolving around the intersection of our world with one very unlike it. The real hero of the tale is a sheepman living in a different dimension within the heart of a modern hotel  a sort of shaman the narrator met before in Wild Sheep Chase (1989)  the novel which first established Murakami's reputation in this country. Along with these characters is a clairvoyant teenage girl  a one-armed beach-combing poet  two or three extremely erotic prostitutes  a lonely and slightly sinister filmstar  and a nervous desk clerk. How these odd characters fit into Murakami's wild and hilarious idea of a plot is impossible to describe  but once picked up  Dance is hard to put down. Unfortunately  while the twists in Murakami's imagination carry the reader along  the novel wilts in one or two places  which may disappoint some readers after the never-takes-a-breath action of the finer Hardboilded Wonderland and the End of the World (1991). Still  this is a wholly endearing tale  very sexy  very adult  and in its own way very tender. Murakami is truly a novelist like no other.

With the End in Mind : How to Live and Die Well Review “I got to the end of Kathryn Mannix’s book with just one thought – I wish I’d been a palliative consultant… An essential read for all of us who are going to die. And that is all of us… A reminder that talking about death is an Act of Love” Greg Wise‘Extraordinary and profoundly moving. Is it not often that a book commends itself because you sense quite simply that the writer is a good person  this is one such. Any reader will come away with the wish that they will be cared for at the end by someone with Mannix’s imaginative sympathy and matter-of-fact generosity of perception’ Rowan Williams  New Statesman‘The stories read like fiction  the life in each shines through and the characters practically leap off the page. It is incredibly moving  of course  but what it isn’t is miserable. Yes this is a book about death  but it is also a book about joy. There aren’t all that many books that change the way you see the world. This book really might. It will make you want to do a better job of loving and living. It will make you want to be kinder. And it will make you want to cherish every precious moment of your precious life.’ Sunday Times‘In the last few years  there has been a crowd of books by doctors  scientists and writers that have sought to show us different  kinder ways of ending: Atul Gawande  Oliver Sacks  Henry Marsh… the list is long. Now Kathryn Mannix joins this distinguished group. Mannix’s aim is to shed a soft  clear light on a subject too often avoided. Mild  tender and conciliatory  I would like her to be my compassionate  wise doctor when I lie dying.’ Observer‘Illuminating and beautiful… Mannix is good company  with a sound eye for an interesting anecdote and a sure ear for language. It’s not a gloomy book… Essential reading for anyone who will encounter death  and that means all of us.’ Cathy Rentzenbrink  The Times About the Author Kathryn Mannix has spent her medical career working with people who have incurable  advanced illnesses. Starting in cancer care and changing career to become a pioneer of the new discipline of palliative medicine  she has worked in teams in hospices  hospitals and in patients’ own homes to deliver palliative care  optimising quality of life even as death is approaching. Having qualified as a Cognitive Behaviour Therapist in 1993  she started the UK’s (possibly the world’s) first CBT clinic exclusively for palliative care patients  and devised ‘CBT First Aid’ training to enable palliative care colleagues to add new skills to their repertoire for helping patients. Kathryn has worked with many thousands of dying people  and has found their ability to deal with illness.

The author submits that these narratives 'mystified' the very limits in the patterns of persuasion by which their social orders were arranged  and thereby 'rendered human association tenable and tolerable.'

Contemporary Political Theory: New Dimensions  Basic Concepts & Major Trends About the Book: Contemporary Political Theory Political theory  generally identifiable with as well as distinguishable from other related themes like political thought  political philosophy  political ideology  political inquiry  political analysis and the like  is by all means the most encompassing intellectual activity. But it remained in a beleaguered state in the twentieth century owing to the impact of many currents and cross-currents inspired by the conflicting interpretations and affirmations of the writers belonging to different schools of thought. In its contemporary form  it is both Liberal and Marxist  empirical and normative  Western a. non-Western  irrespective of the fact that the former aspect outweighs the latter. What is  however  significant is that its study is being revisited in the light of new socio-economic developments occurring all over the world as well as in response to the more subtle intellectual trends unrelated to Political Science as customarily defined. Most of its themes (like liberty  equality and justice) have been revised in the light of such developments and many new themes (such as feminism. terrorism and multiculturalism) have found their place in it. The very concept of the nation-state with sovereignty as its essential attribute is in the process of transformation in the age of globalisation and liberalisation.

Excerpt. © Reprinted by permission. All rights reserved. 1 AFTER THE MIRACLE Several times in my medical career I have been privileged to witness miraculous cures. The most recent began last year when a 32-­year-­old Indian woman came to see me in my office outside Boston. She sat quietly facing me in a blue silk sari. To keep her composure  she clasped her hands tightly in her lap. Her name was Chitra  she said  and together with her husband  Raman  she ran a neighborhood import store in New York City. A few months earlier  Chitra had noticed a small lump in her left breast that was sensitive to the touch. She underwent surgery to remove it  but unfortunately the surgeon found that the lump was malignant. When he explored further  he detected that the cancer had spread to her lungs. After removing the diseased breast and a large portion of tissue around it  Chitra’s doctor gave her initial doses of radiation and then placed her on intensive chemotherapy. This is standard procedure for treating breast cancer and saves many lives. But the lung cancer was going to be much harder to treat  it was obvious to everyone that Chitra was in a very precarious position. Examining her  I noticed that she was very anxious. When I tried to reassure her  she surprised me with a touching statement: “I don’t mind for myself if I have to die  but my husband will be so lonely without me. Sometimes I pretend to be asleep and then sit up all night  just thinking about him. I know Raman loves me  but after I’m gone  he will start seeing American girls. I can’t bear to lose him to an American girl.” She stopped and looked at me with suffering in her eyes. “I know I shouldn’t say that  but I think you understand.” You do not get used to the sorrow that cancer creates  but I felt a deeper sorrow from knowing that time was Chitra’s enemy. For the moment  she still looked healthy. She had even managed to hide her disease from her relatives  dreading having to be watched as she wasted away. We both knew it was going to be very bad for her. No one can say that he knows a cure for advanced breast cancer. Conventional therapy had provided all that it could for Chitra. Given that her cancer had already spread to another organ  the statistics said that her chance of surviving for five years was less than 10 percent  even with the most intensive routine of chemotherapy that could be safely administered. I asked her to start a new course of treatments  as prescribed by Ayurveda. Like me  Chitra had grown up in India  but she had little idea of Ayurveda. Her grandparents’ generation was the last to “believe” in it  I would imagine  today  every progressive Indian living in a big city would prefer Western medicine if he could afford it. To explain to Chitra why I wanted her seemingly to turn her back on progress  I told her that her cancer was not just a physical disease but a holistic one. Her whole body knew she had cancer and was suffering from it  a tissue sample taken from her lungs would show that malignant cells had migrated there  while a sample from her liver would be negative. Yet  her liver had the same blood coursing through it  and therefore it picked up the signals of disease that were coming from the lungs. This in turn affected its own functions. Similarly  when she felt pain in her chest or had to sit down owing to shortness of breath  signals were racing throughout her body  going to and from her brain. Sensing the pain  her brain had to respond to it. The fatigue she was feeling  along with her depression and anxiety  was a brain response that had physical consequences. So it was wrong to think of her cancer as just an isolated tumor that needed to be destroyed. She had a holistic disease and for that she needed holistic medicine. The word holistic  which tends to offend orthodox doctors  simply means an approach that includes the mind and body together. I believe Ayurveda does this better than any alternative  although it may not be very apparent on the surface. In fact  many well-­publicized mind-­body techniques such as hypnosis and biofeedback are far more flashy than Ayurveda. If Chitra had gotten sick at home in Bombay  her grandmother might have fixed her some special meals  brought home medicinal herbs in a brown paper sack from the Ayurvedic pharmacy  and insisted that she stay in bed. Various purgatives and oil massages might be prescribed to clean the body of toxins generated by the cancer. If there was a spiritual tradition in the family  she would have begun to meditate. In essence  I was going to have her do these same things  with a few additions. There is as yet no scientific reason why any of this should work  except that it does. Ayurveda has hit on something deep in nature. Its knowledge is rooted not in technology but in wisdom  which I would define as a reliable understanding of the human organism gathered over many centuries. “I want you to go to a special clinic outside Boston for a week or two ” I told Chitra. “Some things that will happen to you there will seem highly unusual. You are used to the idea of a hospital as a place with respirators  IV tubes  transfusions  and chemotherapy. By that standard  what we will do for you at this clinic will seem like nothing. Basically  I want to get your body into a deep  deep state of rest.” Chitra was a trusting person  she agreed to go. In part  of course  she had no alternative. Modern medicine had done all it could  using the strategy of physical assault on her cancer. The initial advantage of assaulting a disease is that you hope to wipe it out physically as soon as possible. The tremendous disadvantage is that the whole body is damaged in the assault on one of its parts. In the case of chemotherapy  there is the very real danger that the immune system will become so weakened that the door is opened for other cancers to develop in the future. However  untreated breast cancer is considered deadly  and today’s medicine is good at wiping it out over the short run. In a climate of opinion ruled by fear  people prefer to run the risks of the cure rather than the disease. I referred Chitra to the clinic where I work  in Lancaster  Massachusetts. She stayed for a week and received treatments  she also learned an outpatient program to use at home that included a change of diet  some Ayurvedic herbs  a specific daily routine including simple yoga exercises  and instruction in meditation. These measures look different on the surface  but underneath they all aimed at bringing her day-­to-­day existence to a settled  restful state  building a foundation for healing. In Ayurveda  a level of total  deep relaxation is the most important precondition for curing any disorder. The underlying concept is that the body knows how to maintain balance unless thrown off by disease  therefore  if one wants to restore the body’s own healing ability  everything should be done to bring it back into balance. It is a very simple notion that has profound consequences. Chitra was also given two special mental techniques that went directly to the root of her cancer. (I will say more about these later.) Chitra followed her program faithfully and came back to see me every six weeks. She also continued the course of chemotherapy set up by her doctor at home in New York. When we talked about that I said  “If I could confidently put you on nothing but Ayurveda  I would—­the deterioration in your physical state would then be much less. But you came to me a very sick woman  and we know that the chemotherapy works as an outside approach. Let’s combine the outer and the inner and hope that they add up to a real cure.” For almost a year I followed Chitra’s progress. She always listened with a trusting attitude  yet as she returned for each visit  it was clear that she was not improving. Her lung X rays were still bad  her shortness of breath grew worse  and she began to look weaker and more dejected as the disease advanced. Her voice took on a note of panic. Finally the day came when Chitra did not show up for her appointment. I waited out the week and then called her home. The news was not good. Chitra’s husband  Raman  told me that she had suddenly developed a high fever and had to be hospitalized over the weekend. For some time her lungs had been seeping fluid into the pleural cavity that surrounds them  and her doctor suspected that an infection had set in. Given her grim prognosis  there was no guarantee that Chitra would ever leave the hospital. Then a very curious thing happened. After a day or two on antibiotics  Chitra’s fever went from 104 degrees F. back down to normal  which puzzled her attending physician. It is very unusual for a high-­grade fever to reverse itself so rapidly if the underlying cause is an infection in a terminally ill patient. Could there be another cause besides infection? He decided to take chest X rays  and the next day Raman called me sounding both exhilarated and confused."

"12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos Review #1 NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL BESTSELLER “Like the best intellectual polymaths  Peterson invites his readers to embark on their own intellectual  spiritual and ideological journeys into the many topics and disciplines he touches on. It’s a counter-intuitive strategy for a population hooked on the instant gratification of ideological conformity and social media ‘likes ’ but if Peterson is right  you have nothing to lose but your own misery.” —Toronto Star“In a different intellectual league. . . . Peterson can take the most difficult ideas and make them entertaining. This may be why his YouTube videos have had 35 million views. He is fast becoming the closest that academia has to a rock star.” —The Observer“Grow up and man up is the message from this rock-star psychologist. . . . [A] hardline self-help manual of self-reliance  good behaviour  self-betterment and individualism that probably reflects his childhood in rural Canada in the 1960s. As with all self-help manuals  there’s always a kernel of truth. Formerly a Harvard professor  now at the University of Toronto  Peterson retains that whiff of cowboy philosophy—one essay is a homily on doing one thing every day to improve yourself. Another  on bringing up little children to behave  is excellent…. [Peterson] twirls ideas around like a magician.” —Melanie Reid  The Times“You don’t have to agree with [Peterson’s politics] to like this book for  once you discard the self-help label  it becomes fascinating. Peterson is brilliant on many subjects. . . . So what we have here is a baggy  aggressive  in-your-face  get-real book that  ultimately  is an attempt to lead us back to what Peterson sees as the true  the beautiful and the good—i.e. God. In the highest possible sense of the term  I suppose it is a self-help book. . . . Either way  it’s a rocky read  but nobody ever said God was easy.” —Bryan Appleyard  The Times“One of the most eclectic and stimulating public intellectuals at large today  fearless and impassioned.” —The Guardian“Someone with not only humanity and humour  but serious depth and substance. . . . Peterson has a truly cosmopolitan and omnivorous intellect  but one that recognizes that things need grounding in a home if they are ever going to be meaningfully grasped. . . . As well as being funny  there is a burning sincerity to the man which only the most withered cynic could suspect.” —The Spectator“Peterson has become a kind of secular prophet who  in an era of lobotomized conformism  thinks out of the box. . . . His message is overwhelmingly vital.” —Melanie Philips  The Times  About the Author JORDAN B.

"The Great Movies Amazon.com Review If Pauline Kael popularized movie love  Roger Ebert is the eloquent Valentino of cinephiles. This invaluable volume gathers 100 of the Pulitzer winner's mini-essays composed since 1997  revised and updated  to form a love letter that could only spring from decades of devotion. A feat of superlative analysis  historical reflection  personal diary  and journalistic odyssey  The Great Movies combines an accessible style with an academics precision. Accompanied by photos perfectly chosen by Museum of Modern Art film stills archivist Mary Corliss  the 100 films are irrefutably worthy of inclusion  allowing room for debate (John Fords My Darling Clementine is in  The Searchers is not--arguably a wise decision) while placing each film into its own undeniable context of superiority. Admirably  Ebert recognizes that no critic writes in a vacuum  he dedicates the book to eight master critics hailed as teachers  quotes many of his contemporaries  and carries on the debate with Kaels lingering spirit (Ebert counters her on Body Heat  praises her on Nashville). His appreciation of E.T. is written as a letter to beloved children in his life  and the entire book breathes with an awareness of legacy--the cinemas and Eberts own--that underlies the sobering theme of his introduction. We need these movies (and this book) to remind us that movies can be so much better than they typically are. --Jeff Shannon  From Booklist This book presents a Roger Ebert quite different from the TV personality who offers undemanding moviegoers consumer tips on the latest Hollywood releases. Here he chooses 100 great films--not  he stresses  the 100 best films--and explains why they  not this week's batch of mall movies  are the ones that matter. Rising to the level of his subjects  he writes with an eloquence and a conviction he seldom expresses on TV or in his daily newspaper reviews. Unlike contemporary reviews  these assessments are informed by the passage of time and repeated viewings as well as by Ebert's vast general viewing experience. His selections constitute a nice mixture of American and foreign films and of sound and silent films  including inescapable classics (Citizen Kane  Casablanca)  modern masterworks (The Godfather  The Decalogue)  and even a few documentaries (Hoop Dreams  the generation-tracking British -Up films). In his introduction  Ebert chides younger viewers--even film students--who lack any knowledge of the medium's greatest works. If his TV fame leads any of them to pick up this book and subsequently investigate his recommendations  it will go a long way toward making up for his years of simplistic ""thumbs up-thumbs down"" appraisals.

The recognition that the brain in plastic and can actually change itself with exercise and understanding is a huge leap in the history or mankind  far greater than landing on the moon.”- Jane S. Hall  International Psychoanalysis“Only a few decades ago  scientists considered the brain to be fixed or ‘hardwired’ and considered most forms of brain damage  therefore  to be incurable.  Dr. Doidge  an eminent psychiatrist and researcher  was struck by how his patients’ own transformations belied this and set out to explore the new science of neuroplasticity by interviewing both scientific pioneers in neuroscience  and patients who have benefited from neurorehabilitation. Here he describes in fascinating personal narratives how the brain  far from being fixed  has remarkable powers of changing its own structure and compensating for even the most challenging neurological conditions. Doidge’s book is a remarkable and hopeful portrait of the endless adaptability of the human brain.”- Oliver Sack  MD  author of The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat 				    	 					 About the Author Norman Doidge  M.D.  is a psychiatrist  psychoanalyst  and New York Times bestselling author.

His first novel  The Kite Runner  was an international bestseller  published in forty countries. In 2006 he was named a U.S. envoy to UNHCR  The United Nations Refugee Agency. He lives in northern California. 				    	 					 From AudioFile Amir  a rich man's son  grows up in Kabul as playmate and master of Hassan  an ethnic Hazara  a despised Afghani minority. Amir  who tells the story  has ambivalent feelings about both his father and his ultra-loyal friend as the monarchy falls  the Soviets invade  and Afghanistan is thrown into turmoil. Westerners who engage this novel will learn much about Afghani society of the recent past if they can endure the author's narration. In his inexpert voice  the point of view seems insipid and saccharine. But at least the exotic words and names are pronounced correctly.

"Judaism Examined: Essays in Jewish Philosophy and Ethics (Touro College Press Books) Review ""In one of the many felicitous expressions in this wide-ranging book  Moshe Sokol says that Rabbi Soloveitchik  the subject of several penetrating essays here  made Brisk (the town of his Talmudic origin and tradition) speak in the language of Berlin (where Rabbi Soloveitchik studied philosophy). Similarly  through the subtle application of the tools of analytic philosophy  Moshe Sokol makes both Maimonides and Soloveitchik speak in the accents of Oxford. Analytic philosophy often runs the risk of triviality  in the hands of a masterful practitioner such as Moshe Sokol  it becomes a supple tool for clarifying the obscure. Judaism Examined is well worth examining closely!""--Menachem Kellner (University of Haifa) ""Judaism Examined is an excellent collection of eighteen essays that plumbs the depth of Jewish and Western thought. Moshe Sokol's work is a vital contribution to academic scholarship. Readers will gain from and enjoy this book because of Sokol's insightful analysis on a variety of topics  his vast erudition in traditional Jewish sources  and the way he integrates contemporary  secular thought into his writings. . . . His extensive knowledge of the topic is impressive. . . . The book is recommended for scholars  laymen  rabbis  and ethicists  academics in the fields of Jewish studies  philosophy  comparative religion  and cultural studies  and anyone eager to grow in their understanding and knowledge of Western philosophy and Judaism. Space limits for this review do not allow me to do full justice to the richness  depth  and extreme importance of this book. It should serve as a benchmark in the field as an outstanding example of what it means to be a scholar of Jewish studies  a cultured human being open to the best in the Western secular tradition  and a rabbinic scholar.""--David B. Levy (Touro College) ""H-Judaic (July  2014) "" ""Judaism Examined: Essays in Jewish Philosophy and Ethics is a model of meticulous scholarship that is both thoughtful and thought-provoking. Erudite and articulate Judaism Examined: Essays in Jewish Philosophy and Ethics is very highly recommended for personal and academic Judaic Studies reference collections and supplemental reading lists.""--Wisconsin Bookwatch (April 2014) 				    	 					 About the Author Moshe Sokol is dean of the Lander College for Men in Kew Gardens Hills  professor of philosophy  and a member of the Touro College Graduate Faculty of Jewish Studies.

A strikingly vivid  even visceral writer  Lloyd Parry sweeps away distractions . . . to offer tightly focused and consuming human stories . . . Lloyd Parry is uncommonly sensitive to all such spirits  and in the tsunami he has found a horrifying metaphor for those subliminal forces that swirl underneath the manicured surfaces of Japan . . . The ghosts that hover just above his charged and elemental pages are a reminder of how much this land of order remains ruled by things that can't be seen."" ―Pico Iyer  The New York Times Book Review""A lively and nuanced narrative by the British journalist Richard Lloyd Parry  the longtime and widely respected correspondent in Tokyo for the London Times. Though in part he presents vivid accounts of what was a very complex event  with this book he wisely stands back . . . to consider the essence of the story . . . Heartbreaking."" ―Simon Winchester  The New York Review of Books""Powerful . . . Lloyd Parry's account is truly haunting  and remains etched in the brain and heart long after the book is over."" ―Lisa Levy  New Republic""Richard Lloyd Parry wrote People Who Eat Darkness  easily one of the best works of true crime in the past decade . . .

Any writer could compile a laundry list of the horrors that come in the wake of a disaster  Lloyd Parry's book is not that . . . Lloyd Parry writes about the survivors with sensitivity and a rare kind of empathy  he resists the urge to distance himself from the pain in an attempt at emotional self-preservation."" –Michael Schaub  NPR.org""Remarkably written and reported . . . a spellbinding book that is well worth contemplating in an era marked by climate change and natural disaster."" –Kathleen Rooney  The Chicago Tribune""Vivid  suspenseful . . . [Lloyd Parry] re-creates the tragic events in a cinematic style reminiscent of Truman Capote's In Cold Blood . . . There's a harrowing intimacy here  as he brings us into families senseless with grief  the desire for a justice that eludes them . . . Lloyd Parry's elegant  clear-eyed prose allows him to circle ever closer to the heart of Okawa's mystery . . . Part detective story  part cultural history  part dirge  Ghosts of the Tsunami probes the scars of loss and the persistence of courage in the face of unspeakable disaster."" ―Hamilton Cain  Minneapolis Star Tribune""[Lloyd Parry's] writing is always graceful and filled with compassion."" ―Adam Hochschild  The American Scholar""[The book’s] testimonies are almost unbearably moving . . . In an understated way  Ghosts of the Tsunami is not only a vivid  heartfelt description of the disaster  but a subtle portrait of the Japanese nation."" ―Craig Brown  The Mail on Sunday“The stories that Lloyd Parry gives voice to are not only deeply personal but . . . accompanied with essential historical and cultural context that enable the reader to understand the roles of death  grief  and responsibility in Japanese culture―and why some survivors may always remain haunted.” ―Amanda Winterroth  Booklist (starred review)“A brilliant  unflinching account . . . Singular and powerfully strange . . . It is hard to imagine a more insightful account of mass grief and its terrible processes. This book is a future classic of disaster journalism  up there with John Hersey’s Hiroshima.” ―Rachel Cooke  The Guardian“Lloyd Parry combines an analytical dissection of the disaster in all its ramifying web of detail with a novelist’s deft touch for characterization . . . Heartrending . . . it will remain as documentation to the inestimable power of nature and the pitiful frailty of our own.” ―Roger Pulvers  The Japan Times ""Pensive travels in the wake of one of the world's most devastating recent disasters  the Tohoku earthquake of 2011 . . .

True Love : A Practice For Awakening The Heart Love might not be what we think it is. We all seek the happiness that comes from loving and being loved  yet we often find ourselves dissatisfied in our relationships and unable to grasp the cause. Thich Nhat Hanh here shows the way to overcome our recurrent obstacles to love—by learning to be mindful  open  and present with ourselves and others. As he explains  “training is needed in order to love properly  and to be able to give happiness and joy  you must practice deep looking directed toward the person you love. Because if you do not understand this person  you cannot love properly. Understanding is the essence of love.” This quintessential guide to loving also introduces the four key aspects of love described in the Buddhist tradition—loving-kindness  compassion  joy  and freedom—and describes many simple and direct ways in which we can practice authentic love in our everyday lives.

An actor identified?   a scene envisioned?   a location decided?  How was the editing done? All these with the unique challenges of making unconventional  cost effective films in India which are world class.

Well  put it this way...my 13-year-old daughter announced that she had to read a book over the summer holiday and  without any prompting  spotted The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas...and proceeded to read it!

"Conversational Intelligence: How Great Leaders Build Trust and Get Extraordinary Results Review ""Glaser's idea of C-IQ provides an excellent guide to improving effectiveness both on the job and outside the office and should stimulate ""thinking different"" among practitioners  faculty  and students of business. High recommended."" -- Library Journal  starred review ""Before you can persuade others  you need to know how to listen and how to communicate. With the best of intentions  we can fall back into patterns and old habits that are less than ideal -- it's just the way we're wired. Conversational Intelligence builds on the fundamental science of communication to help you achieve more attunement with others. If you're not getting the results you want  maybe it's time to give your 'C-IQ' a boost."" -- Daniel H. Pink  best-selling author of Drive and To Sell Is Human ""In Conversational Intelligence  Judith Glaser takes us on an insightful and in-depth discovery of how trust  the most basic human instinct  creates and fuels the foundation needed to transform cultures and companies.

Intelligence in a digital age is a new admixture: simultaneously crowd-sourced and deeply personal."" -- Michael Levine  PhD  executive director of the Joan Ganz Cooney Center at Sesame Workshop and co-author of Pioneering Literacy in the Digital Wild West ""In her new book  Judith Glaser builds a strong case for how the science and power of conversations can markedly improve business success for both individuals and entire companies. Her approach is both practical and profound: through trust building and level-setting the right conversations  leaders can activate higher engagement  deeper commitment  and transformational results with employees  vendors  and customers. A must-read!"" -- Ed Gilligan  president of American Express ""Drawing on a lifetime of [...] advising America's top executives  Judith Glaser delivers a masterful analysis of the power of conversation  sharing countless examples of how business leaders are driving change and achieving superior results by leveraging the art and science of 'Conversational Intelligence' strategies."" -- Kathee Tesija  executive vice president of Merchandising and Supply Chain of Target ""If each of us used and embodied the principles of Conversational Intelligence conveyed by Glaser in this book  it would not only create winning outcomes for businesses  it would change the world!

In strategy  everything is connected. Freedman shows us how.

"The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business Review “Sharp  provocative  and useful.”—Jim Collins“Few [books] become essential manuals for business and living. The Power of Habit is an exception. Charles Duhigg not only explains how habits are formed but how to kick bad ones and hang on to the good.”—Financial Times “Entertaining . . . enjoyable . . . fascinating . . . a serious look at the science of habit formation and change.”—The New York Times Book Review “Cue: see cover. Routine: read book. Reward: fully comprehend the art of manipulation.”—Bloomberg Businessweek“A fresh examination of how routine behaviors take hold and whether they are susceptible to change . . . The stories that Duhigg has knitted together are all fascinating in their own right  but take on an added dimension when wedded to his examination of habits.”— Associated Press “There’s been a lot of research over the past several years about how our habits shape us  and this work is beautifully described in the new book The Power of Habit.”—David Brooks  The New York Times “A first-rate book—based on an impressive mass of research  written in a lively style and providing just the right balance of intellectual seriousness with practical advice on how to break our bad habits.”—The Economist “I have been spinning like a top since reading The Power of Habit  New York Times journalist Charles Duhigg’s fascinating best-seller about how people  businesses and organizations develop the positive routines that make them productive—and happy.”—The Washington Post “An absolutely fascinating . . . book [that explores] a startling and sometimes dismaying collision between the increasingly sophisticated scientific understanding of habits—how they’re formed  how they can be disrupted and changed—and  among other things  companies’ efforts to use that knowledge to steer your habits and money their way.”—Wired “If Duhigg is right about the nature of habits  which I think he is  then trying to get rid of these bad habits won’t work. Instead  what is needed is to teach the managers to identify the cues that lead to these bad habits and rewards  and then learn alternative routines that lead to similar rewards  i.e. business and personal success.”—Forbes “The Power of Habit is chock-full of fascinating anecdotes . . . how an early twentieth century adman turned Pepsodent into the first bestselling toothpaste by creating the habit of brushing daily  how a team of marketing mavens at Procter & Gamble rescued Febreze from the scrapheap of failed products by recognizing that a fresh smell was a fine reward for a cleaning task  how Michael Phelps’ coach instilled habits that made him an Olympic champion many times over  and how Tony Dungy turned the Indianapolis Colts into a Super Bowl–winning team.”—Los Angeles Times  About the Author CHARLES DUHIGG is an investigative reporter for The New York Times.

"The Yoga Sutras of Patanjali (Sacred Teachings) Review ""Shearer's luminous rendering sings with timeless beauty and force."" -- Parabola  Summer 2002  From the Inside Flap ""A wonderful translation  full of contemporary insight yet luminous with eternal truth.""--Jacob Needleman The Yoga Sutras were cast in their present form in India around the third century b.c. Yoga is from the Sanskrit root meaning ""union "" and a sutra is a thread or aphoristic verse. The basic questions ""Who am I?"" ""Where am I going?"" ""What is the purpose of life?"" are asked by each new generation  and Patanjali's answers form one of the oldest and most vibrant spiritual texts in the world. He explains what yoga is  how it works  and exactly how to purify the mind and let it settle into absolute stillness. This stillness is our own Self. It is the indispensable ground for Enlightenment  which is the ultimate goal of all our aspirations. Alistair Shearer's lucid introduction and superb translation  fully preserving Patanjali's jewel-like style  bring these ancient but vital teachings to those who seek the path of self-knowledge today. Bell Tower's series  Sacred Teachings  offers essential spiritual classics from all traditions. May each book become a trusted companion on the way of truth  encouraging readers to study the wisdom of the ages and put it into practice each day.

Special Education: A Practical Approach for Teachers Education is changing. Special education is changing. More and more students with disabilities are being taught and held accountable for the same content in the same classes as their neighbors and peers. More and more students who are gifted and talented are being identified and expected to demonstrate outstanding achievement as evidence of America's willingness and ability to provide a world-class education to its citizens. More and more  students with disabilities are also being expected to attain world-class standards. We support these changes with one reservation. We believe they cannot and will not happen without providing support for general and special education teachers who will be expected to make them happen. We revised our introduction to special education to meet this need. This is the most practical edition we have written-it contains hundreds of strategies and tactics for teachers working with students with disabilities as well as those who are gifted and talented. Audience and Purpose This book is for people who want to learn more about special education. It is for people attending colleges and universities who are enrolled in undergrad¬ate arid graduate teacher preparation programs. It is for people who are currently teaching who want to learn more about how to make the educational experiences of their students more productive and successful. It is for people who live and work with people with disabilities  gifts  and talents who want assistance with activities of daily living and transition to the world of work. It is a book for teachers  parents  and other professionals who believe as we do that special education is important  necessary  and deserving of change.
"Modern Microeconomics This text provides a thorough exposition of the traditional and the ""modern"" micro-theory. It concentrates on the models of behaviour of the basic economic units  consumers and producers. The main emphasis is on ""oligopoly""  which is the typical market structure of the modern industrial world. In addition  this second edition includes a third part covering the three important topics of the theory of factor pricing  general equilibrium theory and welfare theory. The new edition thus covers all the topics usually included in textbooks on price theory. The book is written at an intermediate level and is designed for undergraduate micro-theory courses. In addition  postgraduate courses in which micro-theory is taught at not too specialized a level could make use of the text. The author has adopted the verbal approach  with extensive use of diagrams to illustrate the verbal exposition. Mathematical proofs (where necessary) are presented in footnotes  or  when in the text  they are printed in small print so as not to interrupt the main theme."

"Relativity (Listen to Genius) About the Author Coming soon... 				    	 					 From AudioFile [Editor's Note: The following is a combined review with THEORIES OF THE UNIVERSE  RELIGION AND SCIENCE  and MY EXPERIMENTS WITH TRUTH.]--The Listen to a Genius series is a collection of CD reissues of recordings made by Audio Scholar in the 1990s. The idea--to present a cross section of writings by the world's greatest thinkers--is admirable. But while the production quality and narration are generally excellent  the series has some problems. First  the complete absence of liner notes is a disappointment. More importantly  the abridgments of these great works are often so drastic that they fail to provide a coherent introduction to the author's work. In his preface to RELATIVITY  for example  Einstein writes that his book requires ""a fair amount of patience and force of will on the part of the reader."" Indeed  a work of this complexity would have a reader continually rereading  something that is impractical in the audio medium. As a result  this recording will likely appeal only to those with a solid background in physics or mathematics  despite Einstein's remarkably lucid prose and the unflinching Julian Lopez-Morillas  who delivers it with clarity. Similar flaws bog down THEORIES OF THE UNIVERSE  also read by Lopez-Morillas. Though Stephen Hawking gets top billing  he is the author of only one of the four selections in this recording. His contribution  like his famous book A BRIEF HISTORY OF TIME (millions sold  perhaps hundreds read and understood)  has fascinating and memorable passages but is altogether impenetrable to the non-physicist. The high point of the recording  rather  is Paul Thagard's ""Conceptual Revolutions "" an erudite but accessible look at the major leaps in scientific thought. Bertrand Russell's RELIGION AND SCIENCE is much easier to digest. Published in 1935  it looks at the conflicts between these two integral parts of human culture. The writing is clear  and the abridgment  while it retains only a fraction of the original work  is tidy if not seamless. David Case sounds pedantic at first  but once listeners warm to him  they'll be happy to have exchanged Einstein's quantum physics for this introduction to Russell's metaphysics. Mohandas Gandhi's MY EXPERIMENTS WITH TRUTH (1925) is an altogether different kind of philosophy. Frederick Davidson has chosen to read this autobiography of India's great spiritual leader with an affected accent  an odd choice in a work of nonfiction. But it works: It helps to ground a rambling piece of writing  helping this title to come closest to fulfilling the aim of the Listen to a Genius series.

"Into Thin Air: A Personal Account of the Mount Everest Disaster (Modern Library Exploration) Amazon.com Review Into Thin Air is a riveting first-hand account of a catastrophic expedition up Mount Everest. In March 1996  Outside magazine sent veteran journalist and seasoned climber Jon Krakauer on an expedition led by celebrated Everest guide Rob Hall. Despite the expertise of Hall and the other leaders  by the end of summit day eight people were dead. Krakauer's book is at once the story of the ill-fated adventure and an analysis of the factors leading up to its tragic end. Written within months of the events it chronicles  Into Thin Air clearly evokes the majestic Everest landscape. As the journey up the mountain progresses  Krakauer puts it in context by recalling the triumphs and perils of other Everest trips throughout history. The author's own anguish over what happened on the mountain is palpable as he leads readers to ponder timeless questions. 				    	 					 From Booklist A handful of people have stood atop Everest  and Krakauer is one of them. Sent to Nepal in May_ 1996 after his success with Into the Wild (1995)  he was to report on the commercialization of ascents of the mountain but was instead compelled to tell an icy story of survival and death. As an inquiry into the outer limits of human strength and into the inner turmoil of survivor's guilt  Krakauer's narrative leaves a reader virtually breathless  sweating as he sweats  gasping as he gasps  crying as he cries over dying friends. The disaster made worldwide headlines last year  and its immediate cause was natural--a freak blizzard caught dozens of people near the summit. But the enabling condition was the mere presence at Everest of amateurs  some with minimal mountaineering skill. Guides  Sherpas  and $65 000 was all one needed to make the attempt. At the summit  the pressures of the guide-client relationship were immense  even overwhelming the imperative to flee the storm that overwhelmed the victims. Krakauer's eyewitness to the unfolding tragedy makes a transfixing drama of hubris  responsibility  and sacrificial heroism  which will mark the memory of all who read it.

The Old Man and the Sea Classic ' The Old Man and the Sea' with Exercises  Glossary and dictionary meaning of the Spanish words used in the book ! In the beginning of The Old Man and the Sea  the readers are introduced to the protagonist  who is unable to catch a single fish for 84 days. As a result of him not being able to catch any fish  Santiago is labeled Salao  which indicates the highest degree of unluckiness. This causes the parents of one of his young apprentices to bar him from travelling with the protagonist but venture out for fishing only with successful fishermen. However  Manolin  his apprentice was faithful to Santiago and visited him regularly. One day  Santiago reveals his plan to Manolin. The plan involves travelling far into the Gulf Stream  with the intention to put an end to this rough patch in his fishing career. On the 85th day  Santiago sets out on his journey  along with his skiff  into the Gulf Stream. A marlin falls prey to his bait and the old man struggles to get the fish onto his boat. This battle between the marlin and Santiago continues for three days  leaving both parties absolutely exhausted. At the end of the third day  the fish began to circle the skiff which indicates that it was fatigued and the old man pulled it in his boat  stabbing it. The battle wasnt over yet  as the trail of blood from the marlin attracts sharks towards the boat. Santiago killed the first shark with his harpoon and lost it in the process. He makes a new weapon and continues to battle with an everincreasing trail of sharks. Will Santiago make it through this intense battle? This book answers these questions and more. The Old Man and the Sea was greatly appreciated by its readers and fetched Hemingway the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in the year 1953. It was also considered the reason behind him being awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature. The book was published in 1952.

"Radical: Taking Back Your Faith from the American Dream Review Responses toRadical“In his compelling new book  Radical  David Platt delivers a powerful picture of the church in America today that  on key points  stands in sharp contrast to what the Bible shows us about the person and purpose of Jesus Christ. David challenges Christians to wake up  trade in false values rooted in the American dream  and embrace the notion that each of us is blessed by God for a global purpose—to make Christ’s glory known to all the nations! This is a must-read for every believer!”—Wess Stafford  president and CEO  Compassion Intl.“We have moved into a generation of young leaders who have a passion to surrender the American dream if necessary in order to embrace fully  compassionately  and wholeheartedly a bigger dream—the Great Commission. I have never been challenged by an author more than I have by David Platt. Read Radical  be blessed  and be changed.”—Johnny Hunt  president  Southern Baptist Convention  and pastor  First Baptist Church of Woodstock“Radical will cause you to bounce on a spectrum between two words: ouch and amen. Tough truths do that. They challenge us to examine our lives and then choose the lasting over the temporary. Read Radical if you’re ready to live differently.”—Gregg Matte  senior pastor  First Baptist Church of Houston“David Platt’s book will leave anyone who sincerely engages with his challenge dissatisfied—and faced with a decision: What will authentic faith look like in my life? This book has the potential to revitalize churches today to practice a radical  biblical lifestyle that can transform society and reach a lost world.”—Jerry Rankin  president  International Mission Board  Southern Baptist Convention“The church of the Lord Jesus has been seduced by a skilled seductress: the American dream. David Platt exposes this enemy of authentic Christianity and provides a way of escape through a radical faith that leads to a radical obedience. I am not the same after reading it. I trust that will also be true for you.”—Daniel L. Akin  president  Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary“It is almost impossible to keep the idols of our own culture from influencing us  whether we want it to happen or not. This is certainly true when it comes to the so-called American dream. We need our eyes opened! We need to be called out! In this challenging and thoughtful book  David Platt shows us the way to live for Someone and something bigger.”—Darrin Patrick  founding pastor  The Journey  St. Louis “Sometimes people will commend a book by saying  ‘You won’t want to put it down.’ I can’t say that about this book. You’ll want to put it down  many times. If you’re like me  as you read David Platt’s Radical  you’ll find yourself uncomfortably targeted by the Holy Spirit. You’ll see just how acclimated you are to the American dream. But you’ll find here another Way  one you know to be true  because you’ve heard it before in the words of the Lord Jesus  perhaps most forcefully in the simple call ‘Follow me.’”—Russell D. Moore  dean  Southern Baptist Theological Seminary “Through solid examination of the Scriptures and compelling testimonies from believers enduring persecution  my friend David Platt pulls back the curtain on subtle dangers weakening the church in our Western culture. Radical is the urgent call we need to care more about the spiritually lost and physically impoverished people of the world.”—Ed Stetzer  president  LifeWay Research --Ed Stetzer  president  LifeWay Research 				    	 					 About the Author DAVID PLATT is theÂ pastor of The Church at Brook Hills  a four-thousand-memberÂ congregation in Birmingham  Alabama.

Stand Strong: You Can Overcome Bullying (and Other Stuff That Keeps You Down) About the Author NICK VUJICIC is an international and New York Times bestselling author  evangelist  motivational speaker  and leader of the nonprofit organization Life Without Limbs. Nick has inspired millions of people around the world  speaking to audiences of all ages about overcoming obstacles  achieving dreams  and never giving up. A longtime resident of Australia  Nick now lives in southern California with his wife  Kanae  and son  Kiyoshi. Visit his website at www.NickVujicic.com. Excerpt. © Reprinted by permission. All rights reserved. I am a bully’s dream  no doubt about it.No arms. No legs. No defense.Born without limbs for reasons never determined  I was blessed in so many other ways. My greatest blessing was a loving and supportive family. They sheltered and encouraged me for the first years of my life. But once I left the protective shelterof family for the hallways and playgrounds of elementary school  I felt like I had a target on my chest that said  “Bullies  aim here.”I felt alone in my fear of bullies  but I wasn’t alone. And neither are you.If you’ve been bullied  the first thing you need to understand is that their attacks  taunts  and mean acts aren’t really about you  any flaws you might have  or anything you might have done. Bullies have their own issues. They pick on you to make themselves feel better  to vent their anger  to feel more powerful  or even because they can’t think of anything else to do.I know it’s lame  but it’s true.When I was a teenager  I wasted a lot of time trying to figure out why bullies picked on me. There was one guy in particular who really got inside my head. He bullied everybody  but for some reason I took it personally. I obsessed over his motives.Finally I realized that his bullying wasn’t about my problems. It was about his.You may have a bully who has had the same impact on you  getting inside your head  knotting your stomach with stress  and tormenting your dreams because you can’t figure out why you are the target. I’m here to ease your mind and lighten that burden.Your bully’s motives don’t matter. You do.Your safety and your happiness are important to me and everyone else who loves and cares about you  so instead of focusing on why a bully is picking on you  let’s focus on helping you feel secure and happy again.Does that sound like a plan? I think so!But before we move on  I want you to know that there is no single infallible strategy for dealing one-on-one with bullies. And I certainly don’t recommend you resort to violence if you can help it! Don’t ever let a bully lure you into a fight. If a bully attacks you  defend yourself but get away as fast as you can. If you have any reason to think a bully is going to harm you physically  you need to talk to an adult who can help you before that happens.The Bullying EpidemicIt’s important to understand from the beginning that many people share your pain in dealing with this problem. Being bullied  sadly  is as common as catching a cold or stubbing your toe. I travel all over the world talking to young people about this issue. No matter where I go  bullying is a major topic of concern. Teens in every school in every town and every country tell me they have mental  emotional  physical  and spiritual pain because of being bullied.A teen in China told me that he’d tried to commit suicide eight times because of being bullied at school. A cute little Korean girl in Boise  Idaho  came up to me crying after I gave a speech on bullying. She said  “I get teased every day about being Korean because I’m the only Asian in the whole school.” I hear similar stories from bullying victims in Chile  Brazil  Australia  Russia  Serbia  and around the world. Bullying is everywhere  and it takes many forms. Most of us are familiar with childhood bullies who threaten to beat us up  make fun of us  or turn friends against us. Adults may experience bullying in the form of sexual harassment or as discrimination based on race  religion  sexual identity  or disabilities. Bullies can be your boss  coworkers  teachers  coaches  boyfriends  or girlfriends—anyone who abuses his power or position.It’s sad to say  but parents can be bullies too. Suicides are a major problem among young people in Asia  and part of the problem is that many teens are under incredible pressure to earn top grades so they can make it into the best schools and get the best jobs for the most pay. Parents naturally want their children to do well  but when a mother and father give love and support only if their child is successful in their eyes  it is a form of bullying. There was one case in which the parents burned their child with cigarettes because her grades were not up to their standards. That’s an extreme case to be sure  but I’ve encountered similar stories around the world.The most common bullying experience is being taunted or ridiculed for being “different” in some way. I’m the poster child for this. For most of my life  I’ve been a bully magnet. I’ve heard every imaginable nasty comment about my lack of limbs. Cruel jokes. Even physical threats.It didn’t help that my family moved a couple of times when I was in school. We went from one side of Australia to the other  then we moved to the United States and back again. At each new school  I wasn’t just the only kid with no arms and no legs  I was usually the only kid in a wheelchair. When we moved to the United States  I hit the bully-target trifecta: I was the only kid in my school with no arms and no legs  the only kid in a wheelchair  and the only kid with an Australian accent! Different? Me  mate?Sure  I stood out from the crowd  and the fact that I was often the new kid without friends made me an even easier target. But I realized early on that bullies would find a reason to pick on anyone. They called the smart kids “nerds ” the tall kids “bird legs ” and the short kids “runts.” If perfect people existed  bullies probably would mock them for being “too perfect.”Still  if you are being bullied  it hurts. It’s a terrible experience that often seems like it will never end. As someone who endured it throughout my teenage years and still runs into it from time to time  I want to give you hope and peace. You can rise above and beyond it.

We are all better for having you do so in the same ferociously honest fashion that you have written this book.” (Los Angeles Times)“Searing  smart  readable. . . . “Hunger ” like Ta-Nehisi Coates’ “Between the World and Me ” interrogates the fortunes of black bodies in public spaces. . . .  Nothing seems gratuitous  a lot seems brave.

"From Bacteria to Bach and Back: The Evolution of Minds Review Intelligence  insight and flair ... They don't come much bigger than Daniel Dennett (Julian Baggini Guardian)One of the world's most original and provocative thinkers (Daily Telegraph) 				    	 					 From the Inside Flap What is human consciousness and how is it possible? These questions fascinate thinking people from poets and painters to physicists  psychologists  and philosophers. This is Daniel C. Dennett's brilliant answer  extending perspectives from his earlier work in surprising directions  exploring the deep interactions of evolution  brains and human culture. Part philosophical whodunnit  part bold scientific conjecture  this landmark work enlarges themes that have sustained Dennett's career at the forefront of philosophical thought. In his inimitable style  laced with wit and thought experiments  Dennett shows how culture enables reflection by installing a profusion of thinking tools  or memes  in our brains  and how language turbocharges this process. The result: a mind that can comprehend the questions it poses  has emerged from a process of cultural evolution. An agenda-setting book for a new generation of philosophers and thinkers  From Bacteria to Bach and Back is essential for anyone who hopes to understand human creativity in all its applications.

"Accessory to War: The Unspoken Alliance Between Astrophysics and the Military Review Extraordinary....A feast of history  an expert tour through thousands of years of war and conquest....Condenses multiple bodies of work into one important  comprehensive and coherent story of the symbiotic developments of astrophysics and war....The lesson is not merely a wake-up call for astrophysicists  but for all of us  for anyone with the misapprehension that science somehow marches on separate from the rest of culture — Jennifer Carson (New York Times Book Review)Through ample research and nimble storytelling  Tyson and [Lang] trace the long and tangled relationship between state power and astronomy....Deep and eloquent. — Joshua Sokol (Washington Post)Fascinating....Retells the history of space exploration  and of the Cold War  excelling in bringing forth the entangled advances of science and military interests....The book’s message rings like a wake-up call. — Marcelo Gleiser (NPR)Archimedes and Leonardo worked for their Departments of Defense  and when the telescope was invented it was an immediate instrument of war. Why do astrophysicists even have jobs? asks Neil deGrasse Tyson. Now you can see the inside story  from early times to the cold war  the Apollo program  spy satellites and the Hubble Space Telescope  the Iraq war  and perhaps asteroid mining. A wonderful book and a fascinating read  full of amazing stories  all backed up with deep scholarship. — John Mather  Winner of the Nobel Prize in PhysicsA sweeping panoramic overview of the enduring alliance between astrophysics and the military—from the Greeks to Galileo to GPS. — ScienceAccessory to War is a phenomenal work that should be required reading for policy makers everywhere. — William E. Burrows  author of Deep Black: Space Espionage and National Security and This New Ocean: The Story of the First Space AgeThis is an indispensable  mind-blowing account about a necessary near-future that is  tragically  not inevitable: that the disciplines of astrophysics and politics unite to forge a new frontier—not through ‘Rumsfeldian-Trumpian truculence ’ or by fattening the military while now starving science and the humanities  or by allowing China to continue to lead the U.S. in ‘worldwide research and development spending.’ These have already killed a supposed American Century. Beautifully combining a clear account of cutting-edge astrophysics and politics with a 3000-year historical perspective  this book deserves not only to be read  but to become a guide for those who hope for a better  survivable  near future. — Walter LaFeber  Tisch Distinguished University Professor Emeritus  Cornell UniversityThroughout history  wars tend to be won by nations that are at the forefront of science. Thus astronomers and physicists have  since ancient times  benefited from an uneasy alliance with the military. This enlightening book explores the history and current implications of this partnership between space science and national security. — Walter Isaacson  author of Steve Jobs and professor of history  Tulane UniversityAccessory to War is not just about astrophysics. It is a readable account of the intersection between science and security policy  complete with historical background and personal insights and anecdotes from America’s most-trusted scientist. This is a much needed read for both policymakers and the public  who in 'normal' times know and care too little about science  but in today's political climate increasingly show disdain for scientific principles that fail to fit their philosophical reality or political goals. Astrophysics is too often perceived as 'not touching me or my life ' but this book artfully explains otherwise. — Joan Johnson-Freese  professor of national security affairs  Naval War CollegeA wide ranging and provocative set of observations on the two-way relationship between science-based knowledge and national power  especially power of the military variety  replete with trenchant insights. Tyson and Lang’s hopeful concluding message is on-target—that knowledge-based dominance  either in space or on Earth  is not possible in today’s interconnected world  and that cooperation in the use of our knowledge is the necessary path to planetary well-being. — John M. Logsdon  professor emeritus  Space Policy Institute  George Washington University 				    	 					 About the Author NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON is an astrophysicist with the American Museum of Natural History  director of its world-famous Hayden Planetarium  host of the hit radio and TV show StarTalk  and an award-winning author.

"First You Write a Sentence Review What a lovely thing this is: a book that delights in the sheer textural joy of good sentences. Joe Moran has written a book about writing that is itself a collection of sentences to inspire  divert and console. Any aspiring writer should read it  if only to be reminded how crazily hard it is to write words 'in such a way that they can be deciphered in your absence' (Bee Wilson)Thoughtful  engaging  and lively exposé of the quirks and beauties of the full sentence . . . It's a style guide by stealth: when you've read it  you realise you've changed your attitude to writing (and reading). (John Simpson  formerly Chief Editor of the OED and author of The Word Detective)Joe Moran is the most perceptive and original observer of British life that we have (Matthew Engel)Moran has fast become Britain's foremost explorer and explainer of the disregarded (Juliet Gardiner  author of 'Wartime: Britain 1939-1945')Moran is a past master at producing fine  accessible non-fiction.

His trick is to take what might be considered a perfectly ordinary behaviour ... and uncover fact after fascinating fact (Helen Davies Sunday Times) 				    	 					 From the Inside Flap The sentence is the common ground where every writer walks.A poet writes in sentences  but so does the unsung author who came up with Items trapped in doors cause delays. A good sentence can be written (and read) by anyone if we simply give it the gift of our time  and it is as close as most of us will get to making something truly beautiful. Enter widely-acclaimed author Professor Joe Moran. Using minimal technical terms  First You Write a Sentence is his unpedantic but authoritative explanation of how the most ordinary words can be turned into verbal constellations of extraordinary grace. Using sources ranging from the Bible and Shakespeare to George Orwell and Maggie Nelson  and scientific studies of what can best fire the reader's mind  he shows how we can all write in a way that is clear  compelling and alive. Whether dealing with finding the ideal word  building a sentence or constructing a paragraph  First You Write a Sentence informs by light example: much richer than a style guide  it can be read not just for instruction but for pleasure and delight. And along the way it shows how good writing can help us notice the world  make ourselves known to others and live more meaningful lives. It's an elegant gem in praise of the English sentence.              See all Product description"

This important text will influence the next generations of student filmmakers and film professors."" ―Thomas Britt  Associate Professor  Film and Video Studies  George Mason University ""I taught with Nic at Columbia University for nearly 28 years before I moved to American University  and I've always admired his excellent teaching and mentorship of students. When he first published the book I immediately adopted it and have used each edition ever since. The pedagogy and insight that he brings to the critical skill of directing helps not only students but all filmmakers. I’ve worked on more than 250 projects over 40 years of teaching and filmmaking  and I apply his techniques professionally as well as in the classroom."" ―Larry Engel  Filmmaker  Associate Professor  School of Communication  American University  Washington DC About the Author Nicholas T.

Seabiscuit: An American Legend (Ballantine Reader's Circle) From The New Yorker Horse stories are staples of young-adult fiction. Hillenbrand  a veteran equestrian writer  attempts something quite different: a full-length biography of the Thoroughbred Seabiscuit  a California racehorse who became one of the sporting world's biggest celebrities in the late thirties. Because her subject left behind few interesting interviews  the author fills out her portrait with people who helped guide Seabiscuit to glory: his owner  Charles Howard  his trainer  Tom Smith  and a hard-luck jockey named Red Pollard. While fans waited for a horse-to-horse showdown with War Admiral  the darling of the Eastern racing establishment  Seabiscuit set several records and battled various injuries. Unfortunately  many of the races are recounted in breathless  melodramatic prose. Far more interesting are the sections that detail the gruelling  hazardous life of a jockey  Pollard  a failed prizefighter with a taste for literature  emerges as the story's true hero.  Copyright © 2005 The New Yorker  Review “Fascinating . . . Vivid . . . A first-rate piece of storytelling  leaving us not only with a vivid portrait of a horse but a fascinating slice of American history as well.”—The New York Times  “Engrossing . . . Fast-moving . . . More than just a horse’s tale  because the humans who owned  trained  and rode Seabiscuit are equally fascinating. . . .

"Dawn of the Code War Review ""John Carlin has written a crucial book- for practitioners and laymen alike-about the evolution  impacts  and implications of the abuses we've all witnessed  and many have personally experienced  in the cyber domain. Cyber is yet another example of the dual-edged nature of technology: huge benefit to mankind on one hand  and the potential for great harm on the other. And  unique to this book  is the historical description of how we have tried to respond to the harmful activities that occur all too frequently in the cyber domain. An interesting read  with vivid detail. John represents a superb amalgam of legal insight and great writing skill. A must read in my view.""―James Clapper  New York Times bestselling author and former Director of National Intelligence""This book is thrilling  important  and deeply fascinating.

A deeply intriguing look into cybersecurity threats facing the United States that will fascinate anyone interested in technology and/or political intrigue."" ―Library Journal""Given the threats Carlin enumerates  including election hacking and the theft of intelligence files  responses ""created and refined in real-time"" are increasingly necessary-but not forthcoming.

"The Code of the Woosters: Jeeves to the Rescue From AudioFile Jonathan Cecil's gifted narration brings uniqueness to this (among the many) audio presentation of the ongoing adventures of Jeeves and Bertie. The narrator adopts a mixture of seriousness and hilarity in this story about a much coveted eighteenth-century cow creamer and Bertie's attempt to ""rescue"" it for his always difficult Aunt Dahlia. It is a credit to Cecil's style that listeners will listen closely to and follow the frequent puns  misunderstandings  and wordplay.

"Parsi Food and Drink and Customs Review I like this book because it has a lot of recipes I remember and has become a regular used book --By 24321431 13 Jun. 2014For those that do not know  the term ""Parsi"" refers to people of the Zoroastrian/Zarathusti religion who left Iran and migrated to India over a thousand years ago to avoid religious persecution. There are only approximatley 150 000 Parsi's in the world today  predominantly in India  but scattered world side. The Parsi's have their own culture and cuisine which is very different from that of the rest of India. The first 86 pages of this book are about Parsi customs  including Navjote (a Bat Mitzvah like ceremony)  marriage  death  Navroz (new year)  etc... The next 300+ pages consist of recepies compiled by the author from a variety of sources (although mainly her family's recepies) including multiple recepies for the same dish for you to pick and choose from (i.e. there are 2 alternative recepies for dhan sakh  plus alternative recepies for masala ni dar  val ni dar  etc...). The book has the best recepie for Dhan Sakh I've tasted outside of India. The only problem is not being in India  some of the ingredients and measurements will have to be translated/converted to make sense (i.e. some recepies ask for 1 1/2 kilos of lamb  100g cholai bhaji  etc...). Definitely get this book if you either are Parsi and trying to cook like mamaiji used to  or are interested in trying a completely new and unique food that you will never find in any Indian restaurant. --By Behram ParekhI bought this book for my wife who has been using it for the last 10 years at least. The first book has seen better days and needs replacing  hence the purchase. You can't get much better when cooking Parsi dishes. I would recommend it to anyony  having sampled the end products. --By Sarosh J. Ghandy 16 July 2014"

Some are wooded  others paved and urban. Some look posh  others hardscrabble. Some are majestic.

He found an incredible diversity in the schools but  also  a universality in the children's play--particularly with boys.--Paul Makovsky ""Metropolis Magazine "" The photos recall the scenes of fun  embarrassment  relaxation  disappointment and anxiety that plague the playground for a growing brain. Although  in retrospect  the notion of playtime tends to acquire a rose-colored glow  Mollison reminds us of the intensity and calamity that often occurred between classes.

""Huffington Post"" The images are stunning in their color and size  and use socio-economic  cultural and political elements as backdrops. ""Wired"" His images capture the similarities of youthful play across social boundaries and national borders  but also the deep divides of class and privilege that are often put in place long before we re old enough to understand their implications. ""Hyperallergic"" Like a living ""Where s Waldo?"" illustration  in each photograph are those echoes of different memories  both good and bad  in the chaotic schoolyard crowd. ""Hyperallergic"" While on assignment  Mollison expanded the project to include schools in Kenya and eventually trekked around the world  photographing playgrounds in more than a dozen countries. He found an incredible diversity in the schools but  also  a universality in the children's play particularly with boys. ""Metropolis Magazine"" "" 				    	 					 From the Inside Flap From Jane Goodall's Introduction: 'In 1859 Darwin shocked much of the world with his theory of evolution. Most people now accept the idea that we have evolved not from the modern great apes - chimpanzees  bonobos  gorillas and orangutans - but a common ancestor: a chimp-like human-like creature who lived some six to seven million years ago. Recent research has revealed startling similarities in the structure of DNA in apes and humans. We differ from chimpanzees by only about one per cent. Chimpanzees and bonobos are closer to humans than they are to gorillas. All three African great apes show more similarities to us than to orangutans. 'In most of the places where they range  the great apes face extinction within the next ten to fifteen years if we do not act to save them. There were probably close to two million chimpanzees across Africa 100 years ago. Today there are no more than 150 000. They are declining in numbers as a result of ever-growing human populations  constantly encroaching the remaining forests  fragmenting remaining habitats  setting snares and hunting. The situation is even worse for mountain gorillas and orangutans. As wild ape numbers decrease  so the population of orphans in sanctuaries is increasing. Chimpanzees  gorillas and bonobos are being hunted  along with elephants  antelopes and myriad other species  for food - and not to feed starving people  but to satisfy a taste for 'bushmeat' among the urban elite. There is not much meat on an infant ape  so often it will be sold alive  illegally  in the market beside the cut-up body of its mother. 'James Mollison's portraits are of the orphans  confiscated from illegal traders  that make up thepopulation of at least nine seven sanctuaries in Africa and Asia. Many of them have seen their mothers killed  and sometimes butchered  in front of them. Each individual ape has his or her own tragic story of pain and trauma. Each one is different. Look into the eyes of each one of them and you will sense their unique personality. 'I hope that James and Other Apes will stimulate thinking  and help people to understand better our place in nature. For many it will be a humbling experience. We are different from other animals (as they are different from each other) but not as different as we thought.' ((c) Jane Goodall) 				    	 					              See all Product description"

Stand Strong: You Can Overcome Bullying (and Other Stuff That Keeps You Down) About the Author NICK VUJICIC is an international and New York Times best-selling author  evangelist  motivational speaker  and leader of the nonprofit organization Life Without Limbs. Nick has inspired millions of people around the world  speaking to audiences of all ages about overcoming obstacles  achieving dreams  and never giving up. A longtime resident of Australia  Nick now lives in southern California with his wife  Kanae  and son  Kiyoshi. Visit his website at www.NickVujicic.com. Excerpt. © Reprinted by permission. All rights reserved. I am a bully’s dream  no doubt about it.No arms. No legs. No defense.Born without limbs for reasons never determined  I was blessed in so many other ways. My greatest blessing was a loving and supportive family. They sheltered and encouraged me for the first years of my life. But once I left the protective shelterof family for the hallways and playgrounds of elementary school  I felt like I had a target on my chest that said  “Bullies  aim here.”I felt alone in my fear of bullies  but I wasn’t alone. And neither are you.If you’ve been bullied  the first thing you need to understand is that their attacks  taunts  and mean acts aren’t really about you  any flaws you might have  or anything you might have done. Bullies have their own issues. They pick on you to make themselves feel better  to vent their anger  to feel more powerful  or even because they can’t think of anything else to do.I know it’s lame  but it’s true.When I was a teenager  I wasted a lot of time trying to figure out why bullies picked on me. There was one guy in particular who really got inside my head. He bullied everybody  but for some reason I took it personally. I obsessed over his motives.Finally I realized that his bullying wasn’t about my problems. It was about his.You may have a bully who has had the same impact on you  getting inside your head  knotting your stomach with stress  and tormenting your dreams because you can’t figure out why you are the target. I’m here to ease your mind and lighten that burden.Your bully’s motives don’t matter. You do.Your safety and your happiness are important to me and everyone else who loves and cares about you  so instead of focusing on why a bully is picking on you  let’s focus on helping you feel secure and happy again.Does that sound like a plan? I think so!But before we move on  I want you to know that there is no single infallible strategy for dealing one-on-one with bullies. And I certainly don’t recommend you resort to violence if you can help it! Don’t ever let a bully lure you into a fight. If a bully attacks you  defend yourself but get away as fast as you can. If you have any reason to think a bully is going to harm you physically  you need to talk to an adult who can help you before that happens.The Bullying EpidemicIt’s important to understand from the beginning that many people share your pain in dealing with this problem. Being bullied  sadly  is as common as catching a cold or stubbing your toe. I travel all over the world talking to young people about this issue. No matter where I go  bullying is a major topic of concern. Teens in every school in every town and every country tell me they have mental  emotional  physical  and spiritual pain because of being bullied.A teen in China told me that he’d tried to commit suicide eight times because of being bullied at school. A cute little Korean girl in Boise  Idaho  came up to me crying after I gave a speech on bullying. She said  “I get teased every day about being Korean because I’m the only Asian in the whole school.” I hear similar stories from bullying victims in Chile  Brazil  Australia  Russia  Serbia  and around the world. Bullying is everywhere  and it takes many forms. Most of us are familiar with childhood bullies who threaten to beat us up  make fun of us  or turn friends against us. Adults may experience bullying in the form of sexual harassment or as discrimination based on race  religion  sexual identity  or disabilities. Bullies can be your boss  coworkers  teachers  coaches  boyfriends  or girlfriends—anyone who abuses his power or position.It’s sad to say  but parents can be bullies too. Suicides are a major problem among young people in Asia  and part of the problem is that many teens are under incredible pressure to earn top grades so they can make it into the best schools and get the best jobs for the most pay. Parents naturally want their children to do well  but when a mother and father give love and support only if their child is successful in their eyes  it is a form of bullying. There was one case in which the parents burned their child with cigarettes because her grades were not up to their standards. That’s an extreme case to be sure  but I’ve encountered similar stories around the world.The most common bullying experience is being taunted or ridiculed for being “different” in some way. I’m the poster child for this. For most of my life  I’ve been a bully magnet. I’ve heard every imaginable nasty comment about my lack of limbs. Cruel jokes. Even physical threats.It didn’t help that my family moved a couple of times when I was in school. We went from one side of Australia to the other  then we moved to the United States and back again. At each new school  I wasn’t just the only kid with no arms and no legs  I was usually the only kid in a wheelchair. When we moved to the United States  I hit the bully-target trifecta: I was the only kid in my school with no arms and no legs  the only kid in a wheelchair  and the only kid with an Australian accent! Different? Me  mate?Sure  I stood out from the crowd  and the fact that I was often the new kid without friends made me an even easier target. But I realized early on that bullies would find a reason to pick on anyone. They called the smart kids “nerds ” the tall kids “bird legs ” and the short kids “runts.” If perfect people existed  bullies probably would mock them for being “too perfect.”Still  if you are being bullied  it hurts. It’s a terrible experience that often seems like it will never end. As someone who endured it throughout my teenage years and still runs into it from time to time  I want to give you hope and peace. You can rise above and beyond it.

A Wrinkle in Time (A Wrinkle in Time Quintet) Review “A Wrinkle in Time is one of my favorite books of all time. I've read it so often  I know it by heart. Meg Murry was my hero growing up. I wanted glasses and braces and my parents to stick me in an attic bedroom. And I so wanted to save Charles Wallace from IT.” ―Meg Cabot“A book that every young person should read  a book that provides a road map for seeking knowledge and compassion even at the worst of times  a book to make the world a better place.” ―Cory Doctorow“An exhilarating experience.” ―Kirkus Reviews“This imaginative book will be read for a long time into the future.” ―Children's Literature About the Author Madeleine L'Engle (1918-2007) was the Newbery Medal-winning author of more than 60 books  including the much-loved A Wrinkle in Time. Born in 1918  L'Engle grew up in New York City  Switzerland  South Carolina and Massachusetts. Her father was a reporter and her mother had studied to be a pianist  and their house was always full of musicians and theater people. L'Engle graduated cum laude from Smith College  then returned to New York to work in the theater. While touring with a play  she wrote her first book  The Small Rain  originally published in 1945. She met her future husband  Hugh Franklin  when they both appeared in The Cherry Orchard. Upon becoming Mrs. Franklin  L'Engle gave up the stage in favor of the typewriter. In the years her three children were growing up  she wrote four more novels. Hugh Franklin temporarily retired from the theater  and the family moved to western Connecticut and for ten years ran a general store. Her book Meet the Austins  an American Library Association Notable Children's Book of 1960  was based on this experience. Her science fantasy classic A Wrinkle in Time was awarded the 1963 Newbery Medal. Two companion novels  A Wind in the Door and A Swiftly Tilting Planet (a Newbery Honor book)  complete what has come to be known as The Time Trilogy  a series that continues to grow in popularity with a new generation of readers. Her 1980 book A Ring of Endless Light won the Newbery Honor. L'Engle passed away in 2007 in Litchfield  Connecticut.

What a treat to see so clearly how matter and meaning fit together  from fiction to philosophy to molecular biology  all in one unified vision!’ Daniel C. Dennett"" (Daniel C. Dennett)""In this golden age of enlightened science writing it is stunning that no scientist has ever won the Nobel Prize for Literature. Pulitzer Prizes  yes  but it is time literature's highest award be granted to a scientist whose writings have changed not just science but society. No living scientist is more deserving of such recognition than Richard Dawkins  whose every book reflects his literary genius and scientific substance. Science in the Soul is the perfect embodiment of Nobel quality literature.""""

(Matt Ridley  author of The Rational Optimist and The Evolution of Everything)""A writer of tremendous clarity and force...in full polemical flight  Dawkins is a marvel."" (Kevin Powers Sunday Business Post)""This Dawkins is a dangerous guy. Like Marx. Or Darwin."" (W. Daniel Hillis)""The most influential man of reason…intellectually rigorous to a fault."" (Oliver Thring Sunday Times News Review)""With his latest book  ‘Science in the Soul’  Richard Dawkins continues the legacy of Carl Sagan  though of course  in a more combative mode...Richard Dawkins is one of the best science popularisers of our times. He is also an eminent evolutionary biologist...All the articles in this compilation are ultimately soul-elevating in the sense that they emphasise the importance of reason and spirit of science in approaching many of the problems which we may think as being outside the realm of science or domains where inducing a hostility to a scientific approach is possible....Dawkins is an extraordinarily talented author and persuader ...Dawkins also comes across in this collection of essays as a warm rational scientist who is interestingly so open to the innocent human fascination for the grandeur of nature.""

"Cici A Fairy's Tale 2: Truth in Sight Review ""A fledgling Latina fairy learns she must use her magic responsibly. Quintessential preteen Cici is trying to make sense of a turbulent time in her life: her dad has moved out  she's lost her best friend to the popular clique  and she's learning to control her nascent fairy powers. She has the 'fairy sight  ' which means she sees people with a sort of enhanced vision that helps her understand them (for example  she sees her harried mother as a multitasking octopus). One day at school she finds popular white classmate Kendra's beloved princess doll (fairy sight reveals Kendra to be something of a princess as well). Cici  seizing the opportunity to use her powers  chooses to wield them in an unkind way. When Abuela  also a fairy  finds out what she has done  Cici must own up to her wrongdoings. The plot--a friendship-tinged riff on the 'with great power comes great responsibility' theme--is instantly familiar  even with the fantasy elements. Doused liberally with a comely array of warm pinks and purples  the panels have a keen focus on facial elements and hold a high visual appeal. Though this series outing doesn't explore its issues with much real depth  the pleasing style and familiar subject matter helped to compensate  leaving this with a very episodic  sitcom-like feel. A likable protagonist and fantasy elements make this well-trod ground feel fairly fresh.""--Kirkus Reviews--Journal""Cici is adjusting to her parents' divorce and her newly acquired fairy magic. She spends her weekends at her dad's house with her younger sister  Sofia  who cries the entire time  and her days at school lonely after having a falling out with her best friend. Cici gets to know Kendra  the daughter of the man her mother is seeing. Resentful because she believes that Kendra's life is perfect  Cici plays a mean trick on the other girl  distorting the features on Kendra's beloved doll. This alters Kendra's appearance in a way that only Cici and other fairies can see  which leads the protagonist to believe that it isn't causing any lasting harm. When Cici's grandmother discovers the magical misdeeds  she uses the moment to teach the girl an important lesson about her magic. The themes of divorce  friendship  and the implications of magic will resonate with kids. Spanish language is peppered throughout the text  and the vibrant cartoon illustrations give readers insight into the characters' inner lives. VERDICT: Fans of Ashley Spires's 'Binky' books and Victoria Jamieson's new series 'Pets on the Loose!' will be ready to tackle this next. A wonderful addition to a must-have series.""--School Library Journal--Journal 				    	 					         		         		         	                  	         		About the Author Cori Doerrfeld is a freelance author and illustrator.

"Metaphysics About the Author Aristotle (384 BC - 322 BC) was a Greek philosopher  a student of Plato and teacher of Alexander the Great. His writings cover many subjects  including physics  metaphysics  poetry  theater  music  logic  rhetoric  linguistics  politics  government  ethics  biology  and zoology. Together with Plato and Socrates (Plato's teacher)  Aristotle is one of the most important founding figures in Western philosophy. Aristotle's writings were the first to create a comprehensive system of Western philosophy  encompassing morality and aesthetics  logic and science  politics and metaphysics. Aristotle's views on the physical sciences profoundly shaped medieval scholarship  and their influence extended well into the Renaissance  although they were ultimately replaced by Newtonian physics. In the zoological sciences  some of his observations were confirmed to be accurate only in the 19th century. His works contain the earliest known formal study of logic  which was incorporated in the late 19th century into modern formal logic. In metaphysics  Aristotelianism had a profound influence on philosophical and theological thinking in the Islamic and Jewish traditions in the Middle Ages  and it continues to influence Christian theology  especially the scholastic tradition of the Catholic Church. His ethics  though always influential  gained renewed interest with the modern advent of virtue ethics. All aspects of Aristotle's philosophy continue to be the object of active academic study today. Though Aristotle wrote many elegant treatises and dialogues (Cicero described his literary style as ""a river of gold"")  it is thought that the majority of his writings are now lost and only about one-third of the original works have survived."

The Tender Bar: A Memoir From AudioFile Imagine if your father disappeared before you were born--only to reappear years later as a voice on the radio. J.R. Moehringer's fascinating memoir opens with the premise that men are either good or bad--and his father is not measuring up too well. For guidance  Moehringer turns to a barroom full of neighborhood characters grafted from equal parts Saroyan  Runyan  and Buttafuoco. Considering that the ghost that haunts this story is his father's disembodied voice  Moehringer's reading is especially poignant when relating the few brief conversations he had with his deadbeat dad. Moehringer may not have gotten much from Pops  but he seems to have inherited a gift for storytelling and a voice to go with it.

"Scarlet A: The Ethics  Law  and Politics of Ordinary Abortion Review In this brilliant new book  Watson draws on legal proceedings  bioethics literature  and personal experience  offers cultural and literary analysis  and uses her unique vantage point as a lawyer  bioethicist  and medical educator to develop a thought-provoking and thoroughly fresh perspective on one of the most divisive moral issues of our time. (Mara Buchbinder  Hastings Center Report)[E]xcellent ... Watson has a gift for explaining complex arguments in a simple  easy to understand manner. ... Watson's book is an important contribution to the growing literature on abortion stigma and the moral case for abortion  and its accessible language will make it an excellent text for classrooms and book clubs. Watson's writing style is personal and engaging  making the book a pleasure to read. The ideas it contains are complex and subtle  but the writing is direct and honest. (Anu Kumar  Conscience)A timely reminder about the importance of rational  non-emotional debate around the rights of the individual. (Emerald Street)At last  a new  important  and powerful effort to improve the national abortion debate. Bioethicist and lawyer Katie Watson initiates a rich conversation about the morality of ordinary legal abortion in the context of unwanted pregnancy. This illuminating book builds on the narratives and vocabulary of women's lived experience in deciding about abortion  and it will captivate anyone willing to attend to the complexity and ambiguity of such decisions. (James F. Childress Ph.D  University Professor Emeritus  University of Virginia)Katie Watson is not afraid to acknowledge the moral complexities of abortion  even as she affirms the legal right to access it. Her writing is lively and clear  but she never underestimates readers' ability to engage in serious moral thinking. Watson will make you think about abortion in new  unforgettable ways. (Lisa H. Harris M.D.  Ph.D  University of Michigan)In this refreshingly accessible book Katie Watson  invites readers to a conversation about 'ordinary abortion'―that is  the vast majority of abortions that take place in the U.S. With immense intelligence and sensitivity  and considerable wit  Watson offers new ways to think about this complex issue  and urges readers to continue this conversation with their neighbors and friends. (Carole Joffe Ph.D.  University of California  San Francisco)I would encourage anyone regardless of their current view of abortion to read this book. Watson provides an important perspective of abortion that isn't regularly shared  abortion as a 'routine' and commonly performed procedure  and she deftly explores why the many women who have this procedure rarely speak of it openly. The more perspectives we explore and the more we open our minds to various ways of looking at this topic the more readily we can come to a meaningful understanding. (Louise P. King M.D.  J.D.  Harvard Center for Bioethics) 				    	 					 About the Author Katie Watson is an award-winning professor who has taught bioethics  medical humanities  and constitutional law for fifteen years at Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine. She has been elected a Board member of the American Society for Bioethics and Humanities  Chair of the Ethics Committee and Board member of the National Abortion Federation  and Bioethics Advisor to and Member of the National Medical Council of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America. In 2017  she began practicing law again  and she now splits her time between Northwestern and the ACLU of Illinois  where she is Senior Counsel for the Women's and Reproductive Rights Project."

"Centaur: Shortlisted For The William Hill Sports Book of the Year 2017 Review ""Beautifully written and genuinely revealing. It is brilliant. A work of art  Centaur has a rhythm all of its own but more than that  it has an immense depth of soul and spirit. Declan has been brave enough to show himself raw  at his most vulnerable  and Ami has been clever and empathetic in her telling of the story. Together they have made magical music. The rhythm of the prose reads like a Declan Murphy-ridden race: beautiful and steady  balanced and spiritual before unleashing its dangerous sprint to the line."" (Clare Balding)""Emotional and honest  Centaur is an unflinching look at how Murphy 'came back from the dead' and the heavy price extracted for doing so. Centaur is a book haunted by ghosts: lost careers  lost memories  lost friendships and  most devastatingly of all  lost love... Not only a certain candidate for the William Hill sports book of the year but also sure to be on many non-sports fans' end-of-year lists.""

"Gender and International Relations – an           Introduction Review ""Jill Steans′ Gender and International Relations provides a wonderfully lucid and insightful overview of the rapidly growing body of feminist IR scholarship. The author not only sensitizes the reader to differences among feminist approaches  but also clearly stakes out feminist IR′s place within the so–called Third Debate. In addition to providing a critique of the more traditional IR concerns like the state  nation(alism) and security  the text addresses questions of development and global political economy as well. This text is a must for IR theory courses. I will definitely recommend it to my colleagues and students."" Marianne Marchand  University of Amsterdam  ""This is an exceptionally well written and accessible introduction to the relationship between gender and International Relations. Jill Steans has produced a much needed guide to one of the most important areas of contemporary International Relations theory and practice. This will surely become a standard introductory text for courses on gender and International Relations.""  Steve Smith  University of Wales  ""Jill Steans has written an excellent introductory study of feminist contributions to IR theory – challenging in approach  and comprehensive in range."" Fred Halliday  London School of Economics and Political Science  ""A timely introduction on the relevance of gender to international relations theory.""  Journal of Peace Research ""Extensive  expansive book ... She has negotiated a careful balance between complex material and accessibility. The result is a student–friendly text that can function equally as a resource and support for teaching academics  especially those who wish to introduce feminist perspectives in their teaching of IR. Her book is generous  comprehensive and thought–provoking."" Australian Journal of Political Science  From the Back Cover This book provides a clear and accessible guide for the reader new to the study of gender issues  feminist theories and International Relations – nationalisms and political identity  the state  citizenship and conceptions of political community  security  global political economy and development – to illustrate how gender is central to all of these areas. Drawing upon feminist scholarship from across the social sciences  the text also demonstrates the uses of feminism as critique  and introduces the reader to contemporary theoretical debates in International Relations in ways that ground the discussion in concrete concerns and easily understandable issues. The book will be of particular interest to students and teachers of International Relations. However  since the text assumes no prior knowledge of gender  feminism or International Relations  it will also be useful to the general reader interested in exploring the complexities of thinking about gender issues and feminism in a global context.

Metaphysics - Aristotle 
With the End in Mind: Dying  Death and Wisdom in an Age of Denial Review ‘Extraordinary and profoundly moving. Is it not often that a book commends itself because you sense quite simply that the writer is a good person  this is one such. Any reader will come away with the wish that they will be cared for at the end by someone with Mannix’s imaginative sympathy and matter-of-fact generosity of perception’ Rowan Williams  New Statesman‘The stories read like fiction  from a writer well attuned to her craft. The life in each shines through and the characters practically leap off the page. It is incredibly moving  of course  but what it isn’t is miserable. Yes this is a book about death  but it is also a book about joy. There aren’t all that many books that change the way you see the world. This book really might. It will make you want to do a better job of loving and living. It will make you want to be kinder. And it will make you want to cherish every precious moment of your precious life.’ Sunday Times‘In the last few years  there has been a crowd of books by doctors  scientists and writers that have sought to show us different  kinder ways of ending: Atul Gawande  Oliver Sacks  Henry Marsh… the list is long. Now Kathryn Mannix joins this distinguished group. Mannix’s aim is to shed a soft  clear light on a subject too often avoided. Mild  tender and conciliatory  I would like her to be my compassionate  wise doctor when I lie dying.’ Observer‘Illuminating and beautiful… Mannix is good company  with a sound eye for an interesting anecdote and a sure ear for language. It’s not a gloomy book. I shed a few tears but it’s not gut wrenching and Mannix weaves the light and dark strands of her experience with finesse. It’s essential reading for anyone who will encounter death  and that means all of us.’ Cathy Rentzenbrink  The Times About the Author Kathryn Mannix has spent her medical career working with people who have incurable  advanced illnesses. Starting in cancer care and changing career to become a pioneer of the new discipline of palliative medicine  she has worked in teams in hospices  hospitals and in patients’ own homes to deliver palliative care  optimising quality of life even as death is approaching. Having qualified as a Cognitive Behaviour Therapist in 1993  she started the UK’s (possibly the world’s) first CBT clinic exclusively for palliative care patients and devised ‘CBT First Aid’ training to enable palliative care colleagues to add new skills to their repertoire for helping patients.

"Fear: Trump in the White House Review `As special counsel Robert Mueller's probe into the murky 2016 election that brought Trump to power moves towards a likely-to-be-sensational finale  Fear will help you discuss the inevitable crisis intelligibly' -- Peter McKay * Daily Mail * 'I've been on the receiving end of a Bob Woodward book. There were quotes in it I didn't like. But never once-never-did I think Woodward made it up. Anonymous sources have looser lips and may take liberties. But Woodward always plays is straight. Someone told it to him.' -- Ari Fleisher  White House Press Secretary for George W. Bush 'I wonder how many journalists have arrived in Washington over the years dreaming of becoming the next Bob Woodward . . . Though his books are often sensational  he is the opposite of sensationalist. He's diligent  rigorous  fastidious about the facts  and studiously ethical. There's something almost monastic about his method . . . He's Washington's chronicler in chief.' -- Nick Bryant * BBC * 'Fear depicts a White House awash in dysfunction  where the Lord of the Flies is the closest thing to an owner's manual.' * The Guardian * 'His work has been factually unassailable . . . In an age of `alternative facts' and corrosive tweets about `fake news ' Woodward is truth's gold standard.' -- Jill Abramson * The Washington Post * 'He is the master and I'd trust him over politicians of either party any day of the week.' -- Peter Baker * New York Times * 'To me the standout message from the book...is that the president is a bit clueless  a bit vain  a bit dangerous even  but his people are utterly at sea...' -- Justin Webb * The Times * 'Horribly fascinating. Strongly recommended. If you can bear it.' -- Richard Dawkins 'Woodward's meticulous account of office intrigues  the president's men don't seem to be trembling with fright. What they mostly feel is contempt for Trump or pity for his ignorance and the ""teenage logic"" of his obsessively vented grievances.' * The Observer * 'Fuelling his narrative is an astonishing cast of rogues  ideologues  self-made millionaires and men in uniform who have spent the past two years in and out of Trump's administration.' * The Sunday Times * 'The sheer weight of anecdotes depicts a man with no empathy and a pathological capacity for lying.' * The Financial Times * 'I think you've always been fair.' -- President Donald J. Trump  in a call to Bob Woodward  August 14  2018 'He has an extraordinary ability to get otherwise responsible adults to spill [their] guts to him...his ability to get people to talk about stuff they shouldn't be talking about is just extraordinary and may be unique.' -- Robert Gates  former director of the CIA and Secretary of Defense  on Woodward 'Donald Trump is about to get the Bob Woodward treatment.' * CNN * 'Senior officials  acting as lone wolves concerned with preserving their own reputations  spoke to Woodward on their own - with some granting him hours of their time out of a fear of being the last person in the room to offer his or her viewpoint. As one former administration official put it: ""He hooked somebody  and that put the fear of God in everyone else."" Another former official added: ""It's gonna be killer. Everyone talked with Woodward.""' * Politico * 'In the worldwide capital of leaks and anonymous dishing that is Washington  secrets can be almost impossible to keep. But somehow over the past 19 months  the fact that America's most famous investigative journalist was quietly chipping away at a book that delves into the dysfunctions of President Trump's White House remained largely unknown.' * The Washington Post * 				    	 					 About the Author Bob Woodward is an associate editor at The Washington Post  where he has worked for forty-four years. He has shared in two Pulitzer Prizes  first for The Washington Post’s coverage of the Watergate scandal  and later for coverage of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. He has authored or co-authored twelve #1 national nonfiction bestsellers. He has two daughters  Tali and Diana  and lives in Washington  DC  with his wife  writer Elsa Walsh."

"Skybound: A Journey In Flight Review A profound  euphoric and courageous book about how to live joyously  and how to meet death . . . breathtaking . . . Her journey is as lyrical and complicated as the sky she describes  and her book is a shimmering parting gift to those still earthbound Source: GuardianSkybound is a soaring gift of a book. A moving meditation on landscapes and the leaving of them  the freedom of travelling beyond our fears and how our journeys between the known and the unknown  the familiar and the unfamiliar can teach us to cherish and see again. Author: Owen SheersIt's early for predictions  but I'm sure Rebecca Loncraine's Skybound is going to be one of my books of the year. It's a book that makes you look at the sky and the land with new eyes  that gives you a lift  in more ways than one . . . an extraordinary book . . . a celebration of wind and wings . . . we've lost a huge talent Source: Daily TelegraphStunning. Rebecca Loncraine is a beautiful writer and thinker and Skybound is so full of life - a love letter to nature and a hymn of love to the parental bond. Author: Cathy Rentzenbrink  author of The Last Act of Love and A Manual for HeartacheA valuable contribution to the literature of flight from a brave young pilot who will sadly never offer us another . . if Skybound is a manual for anything  it's for how to find lift on the Earth in the face of uncertainties . . . I won't soon forget her meditations on fear and flight  on home and family . . . 'Learning to fly ' she wrote  'is like asking the universe . . . to let me go into the world to live and soar with joy and the possibility of death.' It seems safe to conclude that the universe agreed to Loncraine's request  and that in return it asked only that she leave us with this remarkable book Author: Mark Vanhoenacker  author of Skyfaring Source: SpectatorIf you’re looking for beauty  love and courage  read this book Author: Nicholas CraneReading Skybound is the closest you will come to flying without sprouting wings. It is an astonishingly beautiful book  a record of a life that  although heartbreakingly short  was lived vividly and thrillingly and intensely. We must all strive to do what Rebecca undoubtedly did - honour the miracle of our existence. She has left the world with something brilliant and unique. Author: Niall Griffiths  author of GritsAs thoughtful and insightful as it is courageous and inspiring Source: Sunday ExpressAs much a biography of the air as it is a deeply moving memoir  this beautiful book transformed the way I see the sky. I learnt so much about how the air behaves  the physics of gliding. And Loncraine’s affinity for the birds she observes and flies with shines through this fascinating  lovely book Author: James Macdonald Lockhart  author of RaptorSkybound is a profound and exquisitely written witness to the author's flight and fear  wings and woundedness. Then it lifts into something beyond: the beautiful blue brilliance of her mind's sky Author: Jay Griffiths  author of Wild: An Elemental Journey  From the Author Rebecca Loncraine was a British freelance writer. She held a foundation diploma in Fine Art  a first class undergraduate degree in history  and a doctorate in English Literature from Oxford University. She is the author of The Real Wizard of Oz: The Life and Times of L. Frank Baum published by Gotham Books in 2009. Born in England  she grew up on a hill farm in the Black Mountains of Wales  and it was there she returned after her diagnosis of breast cancer. It is also where – after her recovery – she fell in love with glider flying. Rebecca began writing Skybound in response to her new passion and she was just finishing the new book when  in 2015  she became ill again.

"The Loney Review Winner of the Costa First Novel AwardA ""Sunday Times"" Exceptional Novel of 2015A Best Book of 2015 by the ""Times ""and the ""Daily Mail"" A palpable pall of menace hangs over British author Hurley s thrilling first novel  narrated by a London boy  Tonto Smith  whose affectionate nickname was bestowed by a parish priest who likened himself to the Lone Ranger. Tonto and his family undertake an Easter pilgrimage to the Moorings  a house overlooking a treacherous swath of tide-swept Cumbrian coast known as the Loney. Smith s devoutly Catholic mother hopes that taking the waters at the nearby shrine will cure his older brother  Hanny  of his lifelong muteness. But the Cumbrian landscape seems anything but godly: nature frequently manifests in its rawest state and the secretive locals seem beholden to primitive rites and traditions that mock the religious piety of the visitors. Adding to the mystery is Coldbarrow  a spit of land turned twice daily by the tides into an island  where a man  a woman  and a pregnant teenage girl have taken refuge in a gloomy house named Thessaly. Hurley (""Cages and Other Stories"") tantalizes the reader by keeping explanations for what is happening just out of reach  and depicting a natural world beyond understanding. His sensitive portrayal of Tonto and Hanny s relationship and his insights into religious belief and faith give this eerie tale depth and gravity. ""Publishers Weekly  "" starred review When a landslide during a winter storm reveals the body of an infant  the desolate Lancashire coastline known as the Loney is in the news  and the narrator called Smith realizes he must tell the story of his past there. Thirty years earlier Smith s family and other church members undertook an Easter pilgrimage to an old shrine in order to heal his mute brother Hanny and reconvene with God. However  the adventure was one of clashing attitudes  strange locals  loud noises in the night  hidden locked rooms  and miracles that may not have been God s will at all. First-time novelist Hurley weaves an intricate story of dark mystery and unwavering brotherly love that lends itself to many rereads. The characterizations are superb  even the Loney becomes a distinct character as it seems the place  not the people  is to blame for the bizarre happenings. Also  while religion plays a major role  the reference is more an observation of traditions. VERDICT: This eerily atmospheric and engrossing novel will captivate readers who like their fiction with a touch of the gothic. ""Library Journal  "" editor s pick It s not just good  it s great.

"Nine Lives: In Search of the Sacred in Modern India (Vintage Departures) Review ""A singular achievement. . . . A deeply respectful and sympathetic portrait of those modest souls seldom mentioned in the headlines."" —Pico Iyer  Time""Not only a masterful text  but also an extaordinarily important work."" —San Francisco Chronicle""Fascinating and sometimes painfully moving. . . . This is the India we seldom see  peopled by obscure people whose lives are made vivid by their eloquent troubles and reckless piety."" —The New York Times Book Review""[This is] the age for writers like Mr. Dalrymple  who fall in with the rhythms and languages of foreign lands. Nine Lives shows us lives hidden almost entirely from Western readers. . . opening up the world in a compelling way."" —Wall Street Journal“Informed  compassionate  and careful to place the emphasis where it belongs: on the extraordinary people whose stories [Dalrymple] conveys.” —Harper’s  “Strikingly colorful. . . . [Dalrymple’s] point—which he makes elegantly by quoting many voices—is that  as India hurtles toward modernity  it may be losing some of its soul.” —The Washington Post “Luminous. . . . Consists of nine riveting and thickly reported tales of individual devotion  which together summon up a whole world and sometimes end with devastating twists. . . . Nine Lives will only enhance [Dalrymple’s] reputation.” –The New Republic “Fulfills the premise that a master artist can make something very difficult look easy. . . . You don’t have to know a thing about India to enjoy this book  but when you’re done you will know and appreciate much more about its people and their various lives—of the body  of the spirit and of the heart.” —The Seattle Times “Fascinating. . . . These might seem like exotic characters  but Dalrymple allows them to tell their own stories  and they emerge as deeply sympathetic and human.” —Newsday “Triumphant. . . . Not only illuminates India’s relationship with religion but casts the genre itself in a new light. . . . A wise and rewarding book fizzing with Dalrymple’s signature erudition and lightness of touch. . . . The travel book of the year.” —The Guardian (London) “An absolutely beautiful book  clean and honest and edifying and moving. . . . It’s a delight.” —Elizabeth Gilbert  author of Eat  Pray  Love  “A wonderful pageant of believers whose stories are as much about spirituality as about society.”—Christian Science Monitor “Moving. . . His nine articulate individuals are from highly distinctive and unusual milieus  and they embody the tensions and ideals of the great Indian systems of belief in personal  often painful ways. Taken together  they easily subvert conventional notions about Indian religiosity and provide an excellent antidote to much of what one reads in English about Hinduism  Buddhism  and Islam.” —New York Review of Books “Not since Kipling has anyone evoked village India so movingly. . . . The book gives an answer to Christopher Hitchens  Richard Dawkins and those who would condemn all religions for the sake of the fanatical fringe.” —Wendy Doniger  Times Literary Supplement “Straightforward reporting  clear writing and empathetic listening.” —The Plain Dealer “An absorbing book. . . . Dalrymple is a lively  knowledgeable and sympathetic guide to this world of faith.” —The Daily Telegraph “Exquisite. . . . William Dalrymple dazzles us with stories of how a deeper reality strokes the fire of life in the recesses of our souls. . . . By peering into the secret passages of their psyches  we learn more about our own self  our fantasies  our shadows  our longings  our hidden potential.” —Deepak Chopra About the Author William Dalrymple is the author of six previous acclaimed works of history and travel  including City of Djinns  which won the Young British Writer of the Year Prize and the Thomas Cook Travel Book Award  the best-selling From the Holy Mountain  White Mughals  which won Britain’s most prestigious history prize  the Wolfson  and The Last Mughal  which won the Duff Cooper Prize for History and Biography.

New Dark Age: Technology and the End of the Future Review “New Dark Age is among the most unsettling and illuminating books I’ve read about the Internet  which is to say that it is among the most unsettling and illuminating books I’ve read about contemporary life.” – New Yorker “Lucidly argues how our enthusiasm for  and reliance on technology is working against us by undermining our ability to reliably anticipate future risks … Bridle’s multidisciplinary research deftly hopscotches across science  politics and the arts.”—Frieze “I expect many readers will find Bridle’s perceptive and throught provoking book terrifying rather than enjoyable.”—Will Self  Guardian “Highlights the ways in which we are deliberately being kept in the dark and are sleepwalking into a future of non-stop surveillance and ‘the dark clouds [gathering] over our dreams of the digital sublime.’”—Financial Times [summer books of 2018] “My copy of this book is full of underlining and notes that climb around the margins. I feel like those overwhelmed organic chemistry students  highlighting everything because it all matters and it all connects  and yet ultimately the information world he’s describing—none of it makes sense. Which is kind of his point … Dense  demanding  and totally compelling.” —Barbara Fister  Inside Higher Education “An extraordinary  perceptive analysis of the various ways in which the rise of information technology has obscured  rather than illuminated  the operations of power in the world  and diminished our capacity to improve it. It’s brilliant and bracing.”—Mark O Connell  author of To Be a Machine  Guardian (Summer reads selection)“James Bridle is a master of finding contradictions within existing technologies [and] New Dark Age is an important text for the present moment.”—Bernard Hay  The Quietus “A masterful study of all the things approaching out of the future’s night. Compelling and essential.” —Warren Ellis  author of Normal and Transmetropolitan  “James Bridle  one of our surest guides  here offers us a widely informed  deeply felt  and occasionally terrifying course on living in and with the enveloping darkness of our time. It’s a must-read for anyone who’s ever wondered how we might come to terms with technological complexity  and emerge with our humanity intact.”—Adam Greenfield  author of Radical Technologies“Computation brings humanity more darkness than enlightenment: a goblin horde of digital superstitions  invented and unleashed in just half a century. Yet James Bridle is fearless in our gloomy post-truth predicament  he’s a theorist  artist  technical visionary and even a moralist. Has he foreseen the worst?”—Bruce Sterling  author of Pirate Utopia“Technology is not the answer. Nor is it a solution. James Bridle’s lucid and fearless writing instead insists on technology as an open question and urgent problem—which nevertheless needs to be confronted in order to think the present and free the future from false algorithmic certainties.”—Hito Steyerl  author of Duty Free Art “One image that I cannot get out of my head reading James Bridle extraordinary new book is that even as we can access vast tech capabilities we may actually know less and less.” —Saskia Sassen  author of Expulsions “A book-length argument for the idea that vastly proliferating knowledge—from mass surveillance  social media  artificial intelligence  and other sources—is paradoxically making the world harder to comprehend  while the technology that underlies it is creating environmental damage that we’re ill-equipped to understand or solve … Highly nuanced in its analysis of technology  and it provokes [one] to think more about the unspoken social and political assumptions underlying a lot of [the] industry.” —The Verge “An Orwell of the computer age.” —Kirkus“A startling call to arms. Argues convincingly for a more informed integration with the technologies we have created.”—Ben Eastham  ArtReview“The young British artist is spearheading a conceptual-art movement—‘the New Aesthetic’—through Tumblr  Twitter  and Instagram  as he tries to capture technology’s strange effects on society.”—Vanity Fair“A doomy overture to a new era. A work of digital gothic in which the chills are provided by the unpredictable and unstoppable forces we’ve unleashed on the world in the decades since the Manhattan Project.”—Hettie Judah  Vice “Powerful insight and useful provocation throughout. Harrowing and fascinating.” —Jamie Bartlett  Spectator “Original and provoking book.” —Pat Kane  New Scientist “As an artist and author whose work explores the contested intersections of capitalism  surveillance  and computer intelligence  Bridle unravels these vexing issues across his new book.” —Tanner Howard  Rhizome “The glorification of technological progress is one of the cornerstones of the contemporary cultural and artistic mainstream  and Bridle justly stands up against it.” —Nikita Dmitriev  Port  An essential read on the key subjects around AI  and the dangerous feedback loops that are currently being produced. —Ben Vickers  Dazed New Dark Age is enlightening but frightening  a dystopian warning about the implications of the convergence of data and robotics  code and quantum computing  science and technology. —David Gorin  Financial Mail Brilliant and beautiful. —The Australian New Dark Age is a paradoxical work  elegiac yet futuristic  which embraces paradox and the limits of knowledge—especially the limits of knowledge that the present moment’s technological advances  political instability  and environmental chaos have conferred upon us. —Tobias Carroll  Literary Hub Foreboding  at times terrifying  but ultimately motivating account of our technological present … He insists that what is needed is not understanding  but a new language  new metaphors—a new image—that would allow us to look at the darkness directly and—hopefully—begin to see. —Orit Gatt  The White Review Touching on a wide variety of topics  including search algorithms  surveillance  climate change  and many more  Bridle makes a compelling case for pumping the brakes on technology to allow ethics to catch up. —World Literature Today “[James Bridle’s] approach is more accurate than the ahistorical meme that everything is suddenly fake  and more exciting than the truth-hustling of disoriented pundits.” —Nathan Jurgenson  Real Life Magazine “Whichever way the reader veers  the argument that we need better education about technology and more careful thought about what is it for and what is it here to do is a compelling one.” —Tim Sandle  Digital Journal “[James Bridle’s] approach is more accurate than the ahistorical meme that everything is suddenly fake  and more exciting than the truth-hustling of disoriented pundits.” —Nathan Jurgenson  Real Life Magazine “Whichever way the reader veers  the argument that we need better education about technology and more careful thought about what is it for and what is it here to do is a compelling one.” —Tim Sandle  Digital Journal “[New Dark Age] is a shuddering  urgent  brilliant warning about our current direction of travel.” —Hands-Ulrich Obrist  Vulture “Each chapter of New Dark Age provides a different lens that reveals how deeply these imperatives have permeated our social relationships and how opaque they have rendered actual knowledge … [James Bridle] has done us a great service by emphasizing the tangible nature of the infrastructure that constitutes the internet.” —John Thomas  Intercept “[New Dark Age] offers something not often seen from white  male  techno-culture writers (of which there are seemingly so many): an acute sensitivity and unwavering commitment to earthly environments—soil and water—which are profoundly affected by the growth of technological industry.” —Lindsay LeBlanc  Prefix Photo “An unsettling but perceptive read.” —Wired  Best Books of 2018  About the Author James Bridle is a writer  journalist  technologist  and visual artist. He writes for the Guardian  Observer  Wired  Frieze  the Atlantic  and many other publications.
"The Boy in the Striped Pajamas From Booklist Gr. 7-10. Some of the most thought-provoking Holocaust books are about bystanders  including those who say they did not know what was happening. This first novel tells the bystander story from the viewpoint of an innocent child. Bruno is nine when his family moves from their luxurious Berlin home to the country  where ""the Fury"" has appointed Bruno's father commandant. Lost and lonely  the child hates the upheaval  while his stern but kind father celebrates his success because he has learned to follow orders. Bruno can see a concentration camp in the distance  but he has no idea what is going on  even when he eventually meets and makes friends with Shmuel  a boy from Cracow  who lives on the other side of the camp fence. The boys meet every day. They even discover that they have the same birthday. It's all part of a poignant construct: Shmuel is Bruno's alternative self  and as the story builds to a horrifying climax  the innocent's experience brings home the unimaginable horror. Pair this with Anne Frank's classic diary and Anita Lobel's No Pretty Pictures: A Child of War (1998). Hazel RochmanCopyright © American Library Association.

"A Brief History of Time: And Other Essays Amazon.com Review Stephen Hawking  one of the most brilliant theoretical physicists in history  wrote the modern classic A Brief History of Time to help nonscientists understand the questions being asked by scientists today: Where did the universe come from? How and why did it begin? Will it come to an end  and if so  how? Hawking attempts to reveal these questions (and where we're looking for answers) using a minimum of technical jargon. Among the topics gracefully covered are gravity  black holes  the Big Bang  the nature of time  and physicists' search for a grand unifying theory. This is deep science  these concepts are so vast (or so tiny) as to cause vertigo while reading  and one can't help but marvel at Hawking's ability to synthesize this difficult subject for people not used to thinking about things like alternate dimensions. The journey is certainly worth taking  for  as Hawking says  the reward of understanding the universe may be a glimpse of ""the mind of God."" --Therese Littleton  Review “[Hawking] can explain the complexities of cosmological physics with an engaging combination of clarity and wit. . . . His is a brain of extraordinary power.”—The New York Review of Books   “Lively and provocative . . . Mr. Hawking clearly possesses a natural teacher’s gifts—easy  good-natured humor and an ability to illustrate highly complex propositions with analogies plucked from daily life.”—The New York Times   “Even as he sits helpless in his wheelchair  his mind seems to soar ever more brilliantly across the vastness of space and time to unlock the secrets of the universe.”—Time   “This book marries a child’s wonder to a genius’s intellect. We journey into Hawking’s universe while marvelling at his mind.”—The Sunday Times (London)   “A masterful summary of what physicists now think the world is made of and how it got that way.”—The Wall Street Journal   “Charming and lucid . . . [A book of] sunny brilliance.”—The New Yorker               See all Product description"

"How Spacecraft Fly: Spaceflight Without Formulae Review From the reviews: ""Fortunately Graham Swinerd  reader in astronautics at the University of Southampton  has penned... a maths-free guidebook... if only all popular science books were as clearly presented!"" (Four out of five stars  Sean Blair  Sky at Night Magazine  May 2009) ""There is a great deal of useful information that you do not find readily elsewhere and given the rather dry nature of the subject  the book is written in a lucid and engaging style that makes enjoyable reading..."" (Robin Flegg  Astronomy Now  May 2009) ""Aimed at non-technical readers  the book requires `no prior knowledge'. ... The core of the book includes discussion of the various spacecraft subsystems  such as power  propulsion and communications  and a commentary on design. ... The book makes reference to `Star Trek'  warp drive and the space elevator  but only by way of populist garnish."" (Mark Williamson  IET Knowledge Network  May  2009) ""This work is a basic introduction to spacecraft (mainly satellite) engineering ... . The material in this volume should be accessible to any undergraduate who has taken introductory courses in math and physics. ... This work is so fundamental and relevant to the modern world that it will be important for all libraries serving undergraduates. Summing Up: Highly recommended. General readers  lower- and upper-division undergraduates  graduate students  and two-year technical program students."" (A. M. Strauss  Choice  Vol. 46 (8)  April  2009) ""The book concentrates on fundamental topics such as types of orbits  forces influencing orbits ... and the multitude of systems and subsystems associated with spacecraft design. ... This is certainly an interesting and highly readable volume which offers one of the best introductions to spacecraft engineering ... . In conclusion  the author expresses the hope `that this book will play a ... part in inspiring young people to get involved in space science and engineering' - a hope that I heartily endorse."" (Peter Bond  The Observatory  Vol. 129 (1212)  October  2009) ""The challenge of making rocketry and spaceflight understandable to the layman is ... addressed by Professor Swinerd in this new and attractively produced book. ... Written in a friendly style and extensively illustrated with images and graphics the book is well structured and indexed. ... For the non specialist  as well as the non technical  this is a novel and interesting starting point for an armchair journey into space."" (Pat Norris  The Aeronautical Journal  July  2009) 				    	 					 From the Back Cover About half a century ago a small satellite  Sputnik 1  was launched. The satellite did very little other than to transmit a radio signal to announce its presence in orbit. However  this humble beginning heralded the dawn of the Space Age. Today literally thousands of robotic spacecraft have been launched  many of which have flown to far-flung regions of the Solar System carrying with them the human spirit of scientific discovery and exploration. Numerous other satellites have been launched in orbit around the Earth providing services that support our technological society on the ground.How Spacecraft Fly: Spaceflight Without Formulae by Graham Swinerd focuses on how these spacecraft work. The book opens with a historical perspective of how we have come to understand our Solar System and the Universe. It then progresses through orbital flight  rocket science  the hostile environment within which spacecraft operate  and how they are designed. The concluding chapters give a glimpse of what the 21st century may hold in terms of human exploration of the Solar System and more futuristic propulsion technologies for interstellar travel.Graham Swinerd invites you to understand ""how spacecraft fly "" while becoming a convincing rocket scientist along the way!

He lived in a small English village where he raised pigeons  played with his children  and puttered in his garden.Although he lived a quiet life  Charles Darwin started a revolution—a revolution of thought.People have always wondered how life on Earth began. When Charles Darwin lived  most people in Europe and America believed God created the entire world in six days  just as it says in the Bible. But Charles Darwin was not most people. The Beagle voyage taught him to be a true scientist—to look closely at nature  question everything  and think in a new way about how life on Earth started. He showed how living things could naturally change  or evolve  over a long period of time."

Algorithms to Live By: The Computer Science of Human Decisions Review “A remarkable book... A solid  research-based book that’s applicable to real life. The algorithms the authors discuss are  in fact  more applicable to real-life problems than I’d have ever predicted.... It’s well worth the time to find a copy of Algorithms to Live By and dig deeper.”―Forbes“By the end of the book  I was convinced. Not because I endorse the idea of living like some hyper-rational Vulcan  but because computing algorithms could be a surprisingly useful way to embrace the messy compromises of real  non-Vulcan life.”―The Guardian (UK)“I absolutely reveled in this book... It's the perfect antidote to the argument you often hear from young math students: ‘What's the point? I'll never use this in real life!’... The whole business  whether it's the relative simplicity of the 37% rule or the mind-twisting possibilities of game theory  is both potentially practical and highly enjoyable as presented here. Recommended.”―Popular Science (UK)“An entertaining  intelligently presented book... Craftily programmed to build from one good idea to the next... The value of being aware of algorithmic thinking―of the thornier details of ‘human algorithm design ’ as Christian and Griffiths put it―is not just better problem solving  but also greater insight into the human mind. And who doesn’t want to know how we tick?”―Kirkus Reviews“Compelling and entertaining  Algorithms to Live By is packed with practical advice about how to use time  space  and effort more efficiently. And it’s a fascinating exploration of the workings of computer science and the human mind. Whether you want to optimize your to-do list  organize your closet  or understand human memory  this is a great read.”―Charles Duhigg  author of The Power of Habit“In this remarkably lucid  fascinating  and compulsively readable book  Christian and Griffiths show how much we can learn from computers. We’ve all heard about the power of algorithms―but Algorithms to Live By actually explains  brilliantly  how they work  and how we can take advantage of them to make better decisions in our own lives.”―Alison Gopnik  coauthor of The Scientist in the Crib“I’ve been waiting for a book to come along that merges computational models with human psychology―and Christian and Griffiths have succeeded beyond all expectations. This is a wonderful book  written so that anyone can understand the computer science that runs our world―and more importantly  what it means to our lives.”―David Eagleman  author of Incognito: The Secret Lives of the Brain About the Author Brian Christian is the author of The Most Human Human  a Wall Street Journal bestseller  New York Times editors’ choice  and a New Yorker favorite book of the year.

"Oxford Handbook of Clinical Specialties (Oxford Medical Handbooks) Review Review from previous edition This new edition of the Oxford Handbook of Clinical Specialities may appear small in size but don't underestimate it. ... [This] is an essential component of any medical student's bookshelf and will be very useful in guiding you through the main clinical specialities. (Northwing Magazine  University of Sheffield  UK  November 2013)Applying humanism as the basis of delivering medical care  the reward for the physician and proven healing effect for the patient becomes evident. I found this focus delightful and worthy of every physician's consideration... They consistently encourage sympathy and compassion in the many types of patient interactions primary care providers will face and the reward this brings in a career that encompasses patient care from conception to end of life. The authors mine their experience for rich  authoritative insights into these many aspects of medicine. (Doody's Notes  April 2013)Although there are several good pocket-sized medical references  I have not seen one that has the detail and easy format for quick reference as this one does. It includes thoughtful tools and an invitation for feedback from the authors. What I find most appealing is the unique emphasis on the human aspects of practicing medicine that is evident throughout  which is blended well with the more frequently taught technical  knowledge-based information. The authors succeed in their goal of emphasizing connection and compassion as a means to delivering more effective patient care as well as supporting and enhancing the physician's reason for choosing this career. If you are looking for a quick reference medical book  you will not be disappointed. The focus on the perspective of compassionate humans caring for people in need is a particularly useful bonus.

"Atlas of Human Anatomy International Edition (Netter Basic Science) About the Author Frank H. Netter was born in New York City in 1906. He studied art at the Art Students League and the National Academy of Design before entering medical school at New York University  where he received his Doctor of Medicine degree in 1931. During his student years  Dr. Netter's notebook sketches attracted the attention of the medical faculty and other physicians  allowing him to augment his income by illustrating articles and textbooks. He continued illustrating as a sideline after establishing a surgical practice in 1933  but he ultimately opted to give up his practice in favor of a full-time commitment to art. After service in the United States Army during World War II  Dr. Netter began his long collaboration with the CIBA Pharmaceutical Company (now Novartis Pharmaceuticals). This 45-year partnership resulted in the production of the extraordinary collection of medical art so familiar to physicians and other medical professionals worldwide. Icon Learning Systems acquired the Netter Collection in July 2000 and continued to update Dr. Netter's original paintings and to add newly commissioned paintings by artists trained in the style of Dr. Netter. In 2005  Elsevier Inc. purchased the Netter Collection and all publications from Icon Learning Systems. There are now over 50 publications featuring the art of Dr. Netter available through Elsevier Inc. Dr. Netter's works are among the finest examples of the use of illustration in the teaching of medical concepts. The 13-book Netter Collection of Medical Illustrations  which includes the greater part of the more than 20 000 paintings created by Dr. Netter  became and remains one of the most famous medical works ever published. The Netter Atlas of Human Anatomy  first published in 1989  presents the anatomic paintings from the Netter Collection. Now translated into 16 languages  it is the anatomy atlas of choice among medical and health professions students the world over. The Netter illustrations are appreciated not only for their aesthetic qualities  but  more importantly  for their intellectual content. As Dr. Netter wrote in 1949 ""clarification of a subject is the aim and goal of illustration. No matter how beautifully painted  how delicately and subtly rendered a subject may be  it is of little value as a medical illustration if it does not serve to make clear some medical point."" Dr. Netter's planning  conception  point of view  and approach are what inform his paintings and what make them so intellectually valuable. Frank H. Netter  MD  physician and artist  died in 1991."

"Unbreakable Review I started reading the book last night at around 12 and i could not help but finish the book in one go  till 6 in the morning. The most striking quality of this book is the sincerity and ease with which Mary Kom describes her remarkable journey  almost as if she is writing a fairy tale. The book hooks you on in the initial pages because of the description of the lives and struggles of people in Manipur. It is a fascinating insight into the lives of the people there  so distinct in its culture and methods  and one gets the essence of how much of a diverse country India is. Mary Kom then goes on to describe her various hurdles in such a matter of fact way  that it seems too good to be true. The struggles of her parents during childhood  the politics of sports administration  her romantic life with Onler  pregnancy and motherhood  the world championships  the Olympics  all are compacted into neat chapters in the book. What is evident in most of her struggles is the fierce will with which she deals with them  something that influences her description of her life's events in the book. The resulting breezy narrative therefore holds ones imagination as one moves from one event to the other while giving very little time to marvel at the fact that she actually pulled through. I expected that she would write more about the perspectives of multiculturalism and feminism that her success story brings in. But that is restricted to a few lines about how people from the North-East are discriminated based on their looks and not made to feel a part of the nation. She also mentions about how she would want to inspire the girls from various parts of the country. It is heartening to note that despite all her troubles and lack of recognition for so long  Mary is open to working with the Indian government and has already set up an academy in her native place. The issues of political turmoil in the state of Manipur is also restricted to a few pages about her father-in-law's assassination  a decision that shows how apolitical Mary has been with her dedicated pursuit in sports. All in all  a must read for anybody looking for some inspiration through the unbreakable soul of a great great champion. --Shreyas Rao Jan 19  2014Unbreakable is the autobiography of M.C . Mary Kom the best Indian boxer a fighter in true sense. How should I describe this book story of ceaseless struggle or strength or honesty? While going through the pages I felt ashamed. I felt ashamed of myself   my excuses   getting disturbed over trivial matters. Mary proudly introduced her father Apa was an uneducated landless labourer who found it hard to make ends meet . I stopped to think who is an educated person? In spite of all sort of hardships he was determined to give best education to his children. Mary said she was proud of her father. So are we. In her childhood Mary had All work and no play . She had to work in fields I would carry home the straw that was left over after harvesting. She would handle heavy farming tools  sacks of rice. She would carry water across long distance. She would help her mother in cooking  washing  gardening. She would accompany her father to bring fire woods. As a little girl she was also envious to see other children playing but she was an undemanding child . After the days work she would sit down on a mat with a smoky kerosene lamp to do her school homework. Looking back she only finds the positive aspect of her hard toil. Should I describe the book as a love story? A story of a wonderful relationship between Onler and I . Mary was telling I met Onler Kom  and though I didn`t know it then   it was a meeting that would change my life completely. Mary got Onler by her side always. She said People refer to Onler as Mary`s husband   but I know that behind Mary`s success there is Onler Unbreakable is the story of achievement and success. It tells us also about sorrow and shame. It tells about The other face of Manipur . Mary`s father- in -law was killed by unknown insurgents. The way people of her own country behave with the people of Manipurof which we should be ashamed . Mary Kom is the psynonym of struggle and success. --Sreya Ghose Aug 20  2014This is the first biography I've ever read  and am very motivated by this. I was very curious when boxing was introduced for the females in the London Olympics. And was very excited to see Mary contest in it. I always thought about the difficulties she might have been through to come to the ring. Despite having kids  she took the step and never gave up.. I did see the last bout  where Mary lost  but has won millions of hearts  winning a bronze.. Though we got 5 other medals.. this one by Mary was definitely different.. This book tells us all the hardships she went through  and how her ambition rose from getting a decent government job to getting a gold in the Olympics. --vennam anand Dec 22  2013 				    	 					 About the Author Mangte Chungneijang Mary Kom is a boxer  a World Champion five times over and winner of an Olympic bronze in 2012 - the first time that women's boxing was part of the Olympic Games."

"Heretic : Why Islam Needs a Reformation Now Review Praise for Infidel: “Brave  inspiring  and beautifully written…Narrated in clear  vigorous prose  it traces the author’s geographical journey from Mogadishu to Saudi Arabia  Ethiopia and Kenya  and her desperate flight to the Netherlands to escape an arranged marriage.” (The New York Times)“Ayaan Hirsi Ali is one of Europe’s most controversial political figures and a target for terrorists. A notably enigmatic personality whose fierce criticisms of Islam have made her a darling of...conservatives...and...popular with leftists...Soft-spoken but passionate.” (Boston Globe)“Crammed with harrowing details  Hirsi Ali’s account is a significant contribution to our times.” (Kirkus (starred review))“A powerful  compelling read…Put simply  this woman is a heroine.” (The Christian Science Monitor)“A charismatic figure...of arresting and hypnotizing beauty...[who writes] with quite astonishing humor and restraint.” (Christopher Hitchens)“The five areas for Islamic reform highlighted by Ayaan in this book require deep consideration by my fellow Muslims…I thank Ayaan for having the resilience and determination to help in continuing this ongoing conversation.” (Maajid Nawaz  Co-founder and Chair of Quilliam  counter-extremism think-tank)“She is absolutely right to raise difficult issues that must be addressed worldwide  especially by Muslims...I hope that this book will help to stimulate vital discussions for the future of Islam  and in fact for the future of humanity.” (Sheikh Dr. Usama Hasan  imam and Islamic scholar)“Audacious? Quixotic? Visionary? Necessary? All of the above. This an urgent  complicated  risky subject  and Hirsi Ali  valiant  indomitable  and controversial  offers a potent indictment  idealistic blueprint  and galvanizing appeal to both conscience and reason.” (Donna Seaman  Booklist)“Whatever one may think of her solutions  Hirsi Ali should be commended for her unblinking determination to address the problem.” (Andrew Anthony  The Guardian)“A book full of compassion.” (Paul Steenhuis  NRC Handelsblad) 				    	 					 From the Back Cover Is Islam A Religion of Peace?In what is sure to be her most controversial book to date  Ayaan Hirsi Ali makes a powerful case that a religious Reformation is the only way to end the terrorism  sectarian warfare  and repression of women and minorities that each year claim thousands of lives throughout the Muslim world. With bracing candor  the brilliant  charismatic  and uncompromising author of the bestselling Infidel and Nomad argues that it is foolish to insist  as our leaders habitually do  that the violent acts of Islamic extremists can be divorced from the religious doctrine that inspires them. Instead we must confront the fact that they are driven by a political ideology embedded in Islam itself.Today  Hirsi Ali argues  the world's 1.6 billion Muslims can be divided into a minority of extremists  a majority of observant but peaceable Muslims  and a few dissidents who risk their lives by questioning their own religion. But there is only one Islam  and as Hirsi Ali shows  there is no denying that some of its key teachings—not least the duty to wage holy war—inspire violence not just in the Muslim world but in the West as well.For centuries it has seemed that Islam is immune to historical change. But Hirsi Ali is surprisingly optimistic. She has come to believe that a Muslim ""Reformation""—a revision of Islamic doctrine aimed at reconciling the religion with modernity—is at hand  and may even already have begun.Partly in response to the barbaric atrocities of Islamic State and Boko Haram  Muslims around the world have at last begun to speak out for religious reform. Meanwhile  events in the West  such as the shocking Charlie Hebdo massacre  have forced Western liberals to recognize that political Islam poses a mortal threat to free speech. Yet neither Muslim reformers nor Western liberals have so far been able to articulate a coherent program for a Muslim Reformation.This is where Heretic comes in. Boldly challenging centuries of theological orthodoxy  Ayaan Hirsi Ali proposes five key amendments to Islamic doctrine that Muslims must make if they are to bring their religion out of the seventh century and into the twenty-first. She also calls upon the Western world to end its appeasement of radical Islamists—and to drop the bogus argument that those who stand up to them are guilty of ""Islamophobia."" It is the Muslim reformers who need our backing  she argues  not the opponents of free speech.Interweaving her own experiences  historical analogies  and powerful examples from contemporary Muslim societies and cultures  Heretic is not so much a call to arms as a passionate plea for peaceful change and a new era of global tolerance. As jihadists kill thousands  from Nigeria to Syria to Pakistan  this book offers an answer to what is fast becoming the world's number one problem.              See all Product description"

The Book of Saladin: A Novel (The Islam Quintet) Review “The Book of Saladin is the second in a quartet of novels by Tariq Ali on the long encounter between Western Christendom and the world of Islam. Grippingly well told  brilliantly paced  remarkably convincing in its historical depiction of a fateful relationship  it is a narrative for our time  haunted by distant events and characters who are closer to us than we had dreamed.”—Edward Said“Ali overturns demonising stereotypes of Salah-al-Din  portraying instead the 'barbarian' Western invaders. Whether depicting erotically charged harem intrigue or siege warfare  The Book of Saladin is an entertaining feat of revisionist storytelling.”—Simon Carnell  Sunday Times“Ali’s new historical novel ... is told in a manner which combines the incantatory storytelling of the great Middle Eastern anthologies with the solidarity of historical research.”—Philip Hensher  Mail on Sunday“Fiercely lyrical. Weaving political intrigue  gay and straight love  betrayal  cross-dressing  rape  assassination and crimes of passion  Ali's tale ripples with implicit parallels to our age.”—Publishers Weekly  About the Author Tariq Ali is a writer and filmmaker. He has written more than a dozen books on world history and politics—including Pirates of the Caribbean  Bush in Babylon  The Clash of Fundamentalisms and The Obama Syndrome—as well as five novels in his Islam Quintet series and scripts for the stage and screen.

"The Untethered Soul: The Journey Beyond Yourself Review ""This is a seminal book that quite frankly is in a class by itself. In a simple  yet paradoxically profound way  Michael A. Singer takes the reader on a journey that begins with consciousness tethered to the ego and ends having taken us beyond our myopic  contained self-image to a state of inner freedom and liberation. Michael A. Singer's book is a priceless gift to all who have futilely searched and yearned for a richer  more meaningful  creative life."" --Yogi Amrit Desai  internationally recognized pioneer of modern yoga ""East is East and West is West  but Michael A. Singer bridges these two great traditions in a radiant treatise on how to succeed in life from our spiritual quest to our everyday tribulations. Freud said that life was composed of love and work.

Within each human soul there is a longing for more  and the thirst can be quenched only by God. In The Untethered Soul  Michael A. Singer helps the modern person who is seeking this experience to come to a better understanding of the action in their soul. I highly recommend this reflection of one soul to another on the journey."" --Fr. Paul Wierichs  CP  director of the Passionist Monastery and Spiritual Center of Our Lady of Florida ""Michael A. Singer has opened my mind to an entirely new dimension of thought. Through The Untethered Soul  I have been challenged both psychologically and intellectually in a new and exciting way.

In it you will find the mirror to see your unconditional  holy self. If you look for practical spirituality not encumbered by credo and ritual  read this book."" --Rabbi Zalman Schachter-Shalomi  coauthor of Jewish with Feeling and From Age-ing to Sage-ing ""The Untethered Soul is indeed one of the finest treatments of the nature and practice of the conscious use of consciousness that I have ever read.... It is the clearest statement I know of who we are and what we face in our emerging humanity."" --Jean Houston  philosopher  psychologist  and author of A Mythic Life and Passion for the Possible ""In lucid  unadorned prose  Michael A. Singer delivers the essence of the great spiritual teachings of the Ages.

"Early Indians: The Story of Our Ancestors and Where We Came From Review 'Joseph deftly and brilliantly summarizes new findings of genetics that definitively solve old problems in South Asian history  and show we are all migrants and  ultimately  kin. A timely  fascinating and courageous book.' Sheldon Pollock'A remarkably accessible overview of the early stages of ancient Indian history.' Michael Witzel'An amazing book  written in an engaging style . . . It grabs your interest from the first sentence.' Bibek Debroy'Intellectual omnivore Tony Joseph offers an enjoyable meander through a minefield of how our ancestors got here.' Pranay Lal'[A] very readable account . . . should be of interest to anyone curious about the waves of migration and intermixing that resulted in the rich tapestry that makes up the people of today's India.' Venki Ramakrishnan'At a time when the issue of the peopling of the planet by anatomically modern humans is becoming hotter and hotter  Tony Joseph has admirably cooled it down. He goes deep into recent developments in ancient DNA studies on human remains and delves into the issue of the ""Aryan Migration"". This is a vexing issue and not so easy to conclude. However  Joseph has marshalled multidisciplinary data from archaeology  linguistics  genetics and literature to support his stand on the issue. This is perhaps the most scientific way of presenting the Aryan debate. Lucidity is the hallmark of this book.'

"Emma Review - ""Austen's characters are unquestionably one key to her greatness. Her understanding of the human heart is forensic and also frosted with the necessary detachment that gives deeper meaning to her rendering of human frailty. In ""Emma""  Jane Austen shows us the halting development of an adolescent girl from perky narcissism to something approaching empathy."" --""Guardian "" - ""It is the cleverest of books. I especially love the dialogue -- every speech reveals the characters' obsessions and preoccupations  yet it remains perfectly natural...absolutely gripping."" --Susannah Clarke 				    	 					 About the Author Austen lived her entire life as part of a small and close-knit family located on the lower fringes of English gentry. She was educated primarily by her father and older brothers as well as through her own reading. The steadfast support of her family was critical to Austen's development as a professional writer.[3] Austen's artistic apprenticeship lasted from her teenage years until she was about thirty-five years old. During this period  she experimented with various literary forms  including the epistolary novel which she tried and then abandoned  and wrote and extensively revised three major novels and began a fourth.[B] From 1811 until 1816  with the release of Sense and Sensibility (1811)  Pride and Prejudice (1813)  Mansfield Park (1814) and Emma (1816)  she achieved success as a published writer. She wrote two additional novels  Northanger Abbey and Persuasion  both published posthumously in 1818  and began a third  which was eventually titled Sanditon  but died before completing it. Austen's works critique the novels of sensibility of the second half of the eighteenth century and are part of the transition to nineteenth-century realism.[4][C] Austen's plots  though fundamentally comic [5] highlight the dependence of women on marriage to secure social standing and economic security. Like those of Samuel Johnson  one of the strongest influences on her writing  her works are concerned with moral issues. During Austen's lifetime  because she chose to publish anonymously  her works brought her little personal fame and only a few positive reviews. Through the mid-nineteenth century  her novels were admired only by members of the literary elite. However  the publication of her nephew's A Memoir of Jane Austen in 1869 introduced her to a wider public as an appealing personality and kindled popular interest in her works. By the 1940s  Austen was widely accepted in academia as a ""great English writer"". The second half of the twentieth century saw a proliferation of Austen scholarship  which explored many aspects of her novels: artistic  ideological  and historical. In popular culture  a Janeite fan culture has developed  centred on Austen's life  her works  and the various film and television adaptations of them."

Store Indya Hand Carved Folding Religious Book Stand Holder with Intricate Carvings Store Indya is a travel quest to unravel the forgotten hand crafted skills of India…Store Indya was something that was created as a result of family trips we took across India. While travelling  we not only saw different cultures in different parts of India  but we also realized each corner of India has its own secret. They all have their own unique art forms that’s known to only a very few in India  and almost unknown to the rest of the world. We discovered that these age-old glorious skills are getting suppressed. The artisans that we work with are trying to continue the dying legacy of their artwork. Each artwork handcrafted by them is an end product of their hard and meticulous work.Store Indya wants to revive these art forms and at the same time empower these skilled artists. We want to present different art forms and create a whole new product by itself that has never been created before.Overall  these products not only stand for aesthetics and traditions  but the designs on it also represent various socio-cultural issues that we want to talk about with the world and even encourage others to talk about it by gifting these handicrafts to one another. We want our products to not just sit quietly  looking pretty in a corner of your home  but in fact speak your mind. We at Store Indya believe in – “Design to empower.”

SCHAUM'S OUTLINE OF LINEAR ALGEBRA 
"The Theory of Everything: The Origin and Fate of the Universe Amazon.com Review With a title inspired as much by Douglas Adams' Hitchhiker series as Einstein  The Theory of Everything delivers almost as much as it promises. Transcribed from Stephen Hawking's Cambridge Lectures  the slim volume may not present a single theory unifying gravity with the other fundamental forces  but it does carefully explain the state of late 20th-century physics with the great scientist's characteristic humility and charm. Explicitly shunning math  Hawking explains the fruits of 100 years of heavy thinking with metaphors that are simple but never condescending--he compares the settling of the newborn universe into symmetry to the formation of ice crystals in a glass of water  for example. While he explores his own work (especially when speaking about black holes)  he also discusses the important milestones achieved by others like Richard Feynman. Though occasionally an impenetrably obscure phrase does slip by  the reader will find the bulk of the text enlightening and engaging. The material  from the nature of time to the possibility that the universe has no beginning or end  is rich and deep and inevitably ignites metaphysical thinking. After all  Hawking is famous for his ""we would know the mind of God"" remark  which ends the final lecture herein. --Rob Lightner  From the Publisher Audio version delivered by Stephen W. Hawking using a voice synthesizer machine."

"Ballad Of The Whiskey Robber From Booklist It was in October 1988 that 21-year-old Transylvanian Attila Ambrus found himself on the streets of Budapest with nothing but a glint of cleverness  which quickly landed him a position as third-string goalie for Hungary's best hockey team. However  failing to supplement his nonpaying job with janitorial work  or sales of Parker pens and illegal pelts  Ambrus began a series of 29 armed robberies that lasted seven years and captured the imagination of ordinary Hungarians. The robberies were distinguished by their outrageous success  of course  but also by Ambrus' ""fortification"" of choice (hence the moniker Whiskey Robber). Rubenstein offers a well-detailed narrative of Ambrus' robbery spree and the efforts of earnest but underfinanced policeman Lajos Varju to catch him. Readers may agree with the author's implication that Ambrus' journey was quixotic  or they may look at these desperate acts and the sad conditions in Hungary that spawned them and say it was all just a crime.

Now  here's a woman who really knows how to use an active verb. -- Parents  June 1994The popular illustrator and greeting-card artist brings oddball humor and plenty of sassy energy to Boynton on Board  a quartet of concept board books.

The rowdy crew in Monsters bursts in upon a mild-mannered hippo and makes ``the mess that monsters make '' but returns to make amends. Fresh and buoyant  these books are good  clean fun. Ages 1-4.

All rights reserved. Chapter 1. Open Your EyesTHE INVISIBLE ARGUMENTA personal tale of unresisted persuasionTruth springs from argument among friends. —David HumeIt is early in the morning and my seventeen-­year-­old son eats breakfast  giving me a narrow window to use our sole bathroom. I wrap a towel around my waist and approach the sink  avoiding the grim sight in the mirror  as a writer  I don’t have to shave every day. (Marketers despairingly call a consumer like me a “low self-­monitor.”) I do have my standards  though  and hygiene is one. I grab toothbrush and toothpaste. The tube is empty. The nearest replacement sits on a shelf in our freezing basement  and I’m not dressed for the part.“George!” I yell. “Who used all the toothpaste?”A sarcastic voice answers from the other side of the door. “That’s not the point  is it  Dad?” George says. “The point is how we’re going to keep this from happening again.”He has me. I have told him countless times how the most productive arguments use the future tense  the language of choices and decisions.“You’re right ” I say. “You win. Now will you please get me some toothpaste?”“Sure.” George retrieves a tube  happy that he beat his father at an argument.Or did he? Who got what he wanted? In reality  by conceding his point  I persuaded him. If I had simply said  “Don’t be a jerk and get me some toothpaste ” George might have stood there arguing. Instead I made him feel triumphant  triumph made him benevolent  and that got me exactly what I wanted. I achieved the pinnacle of persuasion: not just an agreement  but one that gets an audience—­a teenage one at that—­to do my bidding.No  George  I win.The Matrix  Only CoolerWhat kind of father manipulates his own son? Oh  let’s not call it manipulation. Call it instruction. Any parent should consider rhetoric  the art of argument  one of the essential R’s. Rhetoric is the art of influence  friendship  and eloquence  of ready wit and irrefutable logic. And it harnesses the most powerful of social forces  argument.Whether you sense it or not  argument surrounds you. It plays with your emotions  changes your attitude  talks you into a decision  and goads you to buy things. Argument lies behind political labeling  advertising  jargon  voices  gestures  and guilt trips  it forms a real-­life Matrix  the supreme software that drives our social lives. And rhetoric serves as argument’s decoder. By teaching the tricks we use to persuade one another  the art of persuasion reveals the Matrix in all its manipulative glory.The ancients considered rhetoric the essential skill of leadership—­knowledge so important that they placed it at the center of higher education. It taught them how to speak and write persuasively  produce something to say on every occasion  and make people like them when they spoke. After the ancient Greeks invented it  rhetoric helped create the world’s first democracies. It trained Roman orators such as Julius Caesar and Marcus Tullius Cicero and gave the Bible its finest language. It even inspired William Shakespeare. Every one of America’s founders studied rhetoric  and they used its principles in writing the Constitution.Rhetoric faded in academia during the 1800s  when social scientists dismissed the notion that an individual could stand up to the inexorable forces of history. Who wants to teach leadership when academia doesn’t believe in leaders? At the same time  English lit replaced the classics  and ancient thought fell out of vogue. Nonetheless  a few remarkable people continued to study the art. Daniel Webster picked up rhetoric at Dartmouth by joining a debating society  the United Fraternity  which had an impressive classical library and held weekly debates. Years later  the club changed its name to Alpha Delta and partied its way to immortality by inspiring the movie Animal House. To the brothers’ credit  they didn’t forget their classical heritage entirely  hence the toga party.Scattered colleges and universities still teach rhetoric—­in fact  the art is rapidly gaining popularity among undergraduates—­but outside academia we forgot it almost entirely. What a thing to lose. Imagine stumbling upon Newton’s law of gravity and meeting face-­to-­face with the forces that drive the universe. Or imagine coming across Freud for the first time and suddenly becoming aware of the unconscious  where your id  ego  and superego conduct their silent arguments.I wrote this book for that reason: to lead you through this ill-­known world of argument and welcome you to the Persuasive Elect. Along the way you’ll enhance your image with Aristotle’s three traits of credible leadership: virtue  disinterest  and practical wisdom. You’ll find yourself using logic as a convincing tool  smacking down fallacies and building airtight assertions. Aristotle’s principles will also help you decide which medium—­text? phone? skywriting?—­works best for each message. You will discover a simple strategy to get an argument unstuck when it bogs down in accusation and anger.And that’s just the beginning. The pages to come contain more than a hundred “argument tools” borrowed from ancient texts and adapted to modern situations  along with suggestions for trying the techniques at home  school  or work  or in your community. You will see when logic works best  and when you should lean on an emotional strategy. You’ll acquire mind-­molding figures of speech and ready-­made tactics  including Aristotle’s irresistible enthymeme  a neat bundle of logic that I find easier to use than pronounce. You’ll see how to actually benefit from your own screw-­ups. And you’ll discover the most compelling tools of all in your audience’s own self-­identity.By the end of the book you will have mastered the rhetorical tricks for making an audience eager to listen. People still love a well-­delivered talk  the top professional speakers charge more per person than a Bruce Springsteen concert. I devote a whole chapter to Cicero’s elegant five-­step method for constructing a speech—­invention  arrangement  style  memory  and delivery—­a system that has served the greatest orators for the past two thousand years.Great argument does not always mean elaborate speech  though. The most effective rhetoric disguises its art. And so I’ll reveal a rhetorical device for implanting opinions in people’s heads through sheer sleight of tongue.Besides all these practical tools  rhetoric offers a grander  metaphysical payoff: it jolts you into a fresh new perspective on the human condition. After it awakens you to the argument all around  the world will never seem the same.I myself am living proof.Ooh  Baby  Stir HarderTo see just how pervasive argument is  I recently attempted a whole day without persuasion—­free of advertising  politics  family squabbles  or any psychological manipulation whatsoever. No one would persuade me  and I would avoid persuading them. Heck  I wouldn’t even let myself persuade myself. Nobody  not even I  would tell me what to do.If anyone could consider himself qualified for the experiment  a confirmed hermit like me could. I work for myself  indeed  having dropped out of a career in journalism and publishing  I work by myself  in a cabin a considerable distance from my house. I live in a tiny village in northern New England  a region that boasts the most persuasion-­resistant humans on the planet. Advertisers have nightmares about people like me: no TV  no smartphone  dial-­up Internet. I’m commercial-­free  a walking NPR  my own individual  persuasion-­immune man.As if.My wristwatch alarm goes off at six. I normally use it to coax myself out of bed  but now I ignore it. I stare up at the ceiling  where the smoke detector blinks reassuringly. If the smoke alarm detected smoke  it would alarm  rousing the heaviest sleeper. The philosopher Aristotle would approve of the smoke detector’s rhetoric  he understood the power of emotion as a motivator.For the time being  the detector has nothing to say. But my cat does. She jumps on the bed and sticks her nose in my armpit. As reliable as my watch and twice as annoying  the cat persuades remarkably well for ten dumb pounds of fur. Instead of words she uses gesture and tone of voice—­potent ingredients of argument.I resist stoically. No cat is going to boss me around this morning.The watch beeps again. I wear a Timex Ironman  whose name comes from a self-­abusive athletic event  presumably  if the watch works for a masochist who subjects it to two miles of swimming  a hundred miles of biking  and 26.2 miles of running all in one day  it would work for someone like me who spends his lunch hour walking strenuously down to the brook to see if there are any fish. The ancient Romans would call the Ironman’s brand appeal argumentum a fortiori  “argument from strength.” Its logic goes like this: if something works the hard way  it’s more likely to work the easy way. Advertisers favor the argument from strength. Years ago  Life cereal ran an ad with little Mikey the fussy eater. His two older brothers tested the cereal on him  figuring that if Mikey liked it  anybody would. And he liked it! An argumentum a fortiori cereal ad. My Ironman watch’s own argument from strength does not affect me  however. I bought it because it was practical. Remember  I’m advertising-­immune.But its beeping is driving me crazy. Here I’m not even up yet and I already contemplate emotional appeals from a cat and a smoke detector along with a wristwatch argument from strength. Wrenching myself out of bed  I say to the mirror what I tell it every morning: “Don’t take any crap from anyone.”The cat bites me on the heel. I grab my towel and go fix its breakfast. Five minutes later I’m out of toothpaste and arguing with my son. Not a good start to my experiment  but I’ll chalk it up to what scientists euphemistically call an “artifact” (translation: boneheaded mistake) and move on. I make coffee  grab a pen  and begin writing ostentatiously in a notebook. This does little good in the literary sense—­I can barely read my own scribble before coffee—­but it produces wonderful rhetorical results: when my wife sees me writing  she often brings me breakfast.Did I just violate my own experiment? Shielding the notebook from view  I write a grocery list. There. That counts as writing.Dorothy returned to full-­time work after I quit my job. The deal was that I would take over the cooking  but she loves to see her husband as the inspired author and herself as the able enabler. My wife is a babe  and many babes go for inspired authors. Of course  she might be persuading me: by acting as the kind of babe who goes for inspired authors  she turns me on. Seduction underlies the most insidious  and enjoyable  forms of argument.Seduction is not just for sex  either. Writer Frederick Kaufman showed in Harper’s Magazine how the Food Network uses techniques identical to that of the porn industry—­overmiked sound  very little plot  and good-­looking characters  along with lavish close-­ups of firm flesh and flowing juices.rachael ray: Lentils poof up big when you cook ’em. They just suck up all the liquid as they get nice and tender.emeril lagasse: In go the bananas. Oh  yeah  babe. Get ’em happy right now.We live in a tangled  dark (I almost added “moist”) world of persuasion. A used car salesman once seduced me out of fifteen grand. My family and I had just moved to Connecticut  and I needed cheap transportation. It had been a tough move  I was out of sorts. The man at the car lot had me pegged before I said a word. He pointed to a humble-­looking Ford Taurus sedan  suggested a test drive  and as soon as I buckled in he said  “Want to see P. T. Barnum’s grave?” Of course I did.The place was awesome. We had to stop for peacocks  and brilliant-­green feral Peruvian parrots squawked in the branches of a huge fir tree. Opposite Barnum’s impressive monument stood Tom Thumb’s marker with a life-­sized statue of the millionaire midget. Enthralled by our test drive  I did everything else the salesman suggested  and he suggested I buy the Ford. It was a lemon.He sized me up and changed my mood  he seduced me  and to tell you the truth  I enjoyed it. I had some misgivings the next morning  but no regrets. It was a consensual act.Which leads us to argument’s grand prize: the consensus. It means more than just an agreement  much more than a compromise. The consensus represents an audience’s commonsense thinking. In fact  it is a common sense  a shared faith in a choice—­the decision or action you want. And this is where seduction comes in. As St. Augustine knew  faith requires emotion.Seduction is manipulation  manipulation is half of argument  and therefore many of us shy from it. But seduction offers more than just consensual sex. It can bring you consensus. Even Aristotle  that logical old soul  believed in the curative powers of seduction. Logic alone will rarely get people to do anything. They have to desire the act. You may not like seduction’s manipulative aspects  still  it beats fighting  which is what we usually mistake for an argument.Birds Do It . . . ​Meanwhile  my experiment gets more dubious by the moment. I’m leaving the bathroom when Dorothy puts a plate of eggs on the table  shrugs into her suit jacket  and kisses me goodbye. “Don’t forget  I’ll be home late—­I’m having heavy hors d’oeuvres at the reception tonight ” she says  and leaves for her fundraising job at a law school. (Fundraising and law. Could it get more rhetorical?)I turn to George. “So  want to have dinner with me or on campus tonight?” George attends a boarding school as a day student. He hates the food there.“I don’t know ” he says. “I’ll call you from school.”I want to work late and don’t feel like cooking  but I’m loath to have George think my work takes priority over him. “Okay ” I say  adding with as much enthusiasm as I can fake  “we’ll have stew!”“Ugh ” says George  right on cue. He hates my stew even more than school food. The odds of my cooking tonight have just gone way down.Oops  as that fine rhetorician Britney Spears put it  I did it again. And so goes my day. In my cabin office  I email editors with flattering explanations for missing their deadlines. (I’m just trying to live up to their high standards!) I put off calling Sears to complain about a $147 bill for replacing a screw in our oven. When I do call eventually  I’ll take my time explaining the situation. Giving me a break on the bill will cost less than dealing with me any further.At noon  I grab some lunch and head outside for a walk. A small pile of fox scat lies atop a large granite rock. Mine  the fox says with the scat. This spot belongs to me. Territorial creatures  such as foxes and suburbanites  use complicated signals to mark off terrain and discourage intruders—­musk  fences  scat  marriage licenses  footprints  alarm systems . . . ​Argument is in our nature  literally."

Hall  International Psychoanalysis“Only a few decades ago  scientists considered the brain to be fixed or ‘hardwired’ and considered most forms of brain damage  therefore  to be incurable.  Dr. Doidge  an eminent psychiatrist and researcher  was struck by how his patients’ own transformations belied this and set out to explore the new science of neuroplasticity by interviewing both scientific pioneers in neuroscience  and patients who have benefited from neurorehabilitation. Here he describes in fascinating personal narratives how the brain  far from being fixed  has remarkable powers of changing its own structure and compensating for even the most challenging neurological conditions.

The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined Selected by The New York Times Book Review as a Notable Book of the Year  The author of The New York Times bestseller The Stuff of Thought offers a controversial history of violence. Faced with the ceaseless stream of news about war  crime  and terrorism  one could easily think we live in the most violent age ever seen. Yet as New York Times bestselling author Steven Pinker shows in this startling and engaging new work  just the opposite is true: violence has been diminishing for millennia and we may be living in the most peaceful time in our species's existence. For most of history  war  slavery  infanticide  child abuse  assassinations  pogroms  gruesome punishments  deadly quarrels  and genocide were ordinary features of life. But today  Pinker shows (with the help of more than a hundred graphs and maps) all these forms of violence have dwindled and are widely condemned. How has this happened?This groundbreaking book continues Pinker's exploration of the essence of human nature  mixing psychology and history to provide a remarkable picture of an increasingly nonviolent world. The key  he explains  is to understand our intrinsic motives- the inner demons that incline us toward violence and the better angels that steer us away-and how changing circumstances have allowed our better angels to prevail. Exploding fatalist myths about humankind's inherent violence and the curse of modernity  this ambitious and provocative book is sure to be hotly debated in living rooms and the Pentagon alike  and will challenge and change the way we think about our society.

"Drugs and Drug Policy: What Everyone Needs to Know® Review ""Drugs and Drug Policy is the product of scholarly work but comes in the form of a guidebook of answers to questions simple and complex about everything to do with the two topics. It is fit for both the policymaker and the concerned parent (how many books can this be said of?) because it combines a rigorous analytical approach to drugs without skipping over the social reasons the topic deserves to be discussed in the home. Kleiman  Caulkins and Hawken's review of the nuances of the drug issue can't help but elicit an appreciation for the variety of approaches against drug use that could supplement or substitute for our current top-down one."" --Forbes.com ""Drugs and Drug Policy is a practical book which aims to debunk myths...thoughtful and clearly written."" - The Economist ""A product of genius  in form and content: more than two hundred questions  all relevant and urgent  with succinct and lucid answers. When I started the book  I had strong opinions on many of the topics it covered  again and again--every time the book came into conflict with my original beliefs--the authors changed my mind. If you care about drugs  you need to read this book. If you don't  read it anyway  just to see how it's done."" --Thomas Schelling  2005 Nobel Laureate in Economic Sciences ""In this deceptively simple book  Mark A.R. Kleiman  Jonathan P. Caulkins  and Angela Hawken eviscerate many of the arguments behind the policies that have been the leading weapons in the war on drugs. But they also cast a skeptical eye on some shibboleths of the burgeoning drug reform movement...the authors' penetrating and nuanced critique of the growing calls for legalization is one of the highlights of the book."" -- The New Republic ""This book is incredibly useful  in both format and content. It has made me more aware than ever of the extent to which people are either uninformed or misinformed about most issues having to do with drug policy  drug trafficking  and criminal activity. If Washington's political leaders  government officials  and policy analysts give the book the wide attention it deserves  we might finally begin the kind of serious  rational debate about drug issues that the US and the rest of the world desperately needs."" --Peter Hakim  President Emeritus and Senior Fellow of the Inter-American Dialogue ""[The authors] ask the right questions  and their answers and discussions can benefit anyone connected to the subject-users and enforcers  policy makers and implementers  innocent bystanders and citizens...worth reading."" -Tickle the Wire.com ""An easy-to-read  authoritative guide to the key issues...[The authors] aren't trying to make friends  they are trying to tell the truth as evidence or logic leads them."" --Eric Sterling  President of The Criminal Justice Policy Foundation  Sterling on Justice & Drugs ""The authors are refreshingly candid about the trade-offs and limitations of drug policy  and through a series of brief answers to 143 questions  they provide a well-written and generally fair-minded summary of the vast literatures bearing on drug problems."" --Health Affairs 				    	 					 About the Author Mark A.R.

"Swami Vivekananda: A Biography Swami Vivekananda  was an Indian Hindu monk and chief disciple of the 19th-century saint Ramakrishna. He was a key figure in the introduction of the Indian philosophies of Vedanta and Yoga to the Western world and is credited with raising interfaith awareness  bringing Hinduism to the status of a major world religion during the late 19th century. He was a major force in the revival of Hinduism in India  and contributed to the concept of nationalism in colonial India. Vivekananda founded the Ramakrishna Math and the Ramakrishna Mission. He is perhaps best known for his inspiring speech which began  ""Sisters and brothers of America ... "" in which he introduced Hinduism at the Parliament of the World's Religions in Chicago in 1893. Vivekananda conducted hundreds of public and private lectures and classes  disseminating tenets of Hindu philosophy in the U.S.  England and Europe. In India  Vivekananda is regarded as a patriotic saint and his birthday is celebrated as National Youth Day in India."

"Leftism in India  1917–1947 Review ‘We are in debt to Professor Satyabrata Rai Chowdhuri for writing this excellent overview of the Indian Left. This will be a very useful book for experts and for people who want an overview of the Left. His book is especially welcome because of its wide scope. Let us hope that he is planning a successor volume that will bring this remarkable story of communism in India up to the present day.’  (Stephen P. Cohen  The Brookings Institution)‘Professor Rai Chowdhuri has to be congratulated on such a comprehensive coverage of not only the Communist Party history but also the Left movements in general in India. I also like his interweaving of the history of the mainstream nationalist movement with a history of the Left. There are not many books which cover the same ground and this one  I am sure  will stay a standard reference work for a long time.’  (Meghnad Desai  London School of Economics and Political Science)‘[This book is] one of the most lucid  nuanced and comprehensive accounts of the role of the political Left in Indian nationalism I have ever read. While many other scholarly accounts have commented on the heterogeneity of Leftist movements in India  few have attempted to delineate in such detail and with such clarity every hue  every highlight and every shade in the entire spectrum of Left politics in the era of high nationalism from 1917 to 1947. It is a task of commendable magnitude accomplished by a distinguished scholar. It will serve as an invaluable resource for both undergraduate and postgraduate students of Indian political history.’  (Debjani Ganguly  Australian National University)‘Leftism in India  1917–1947  is an excellent account of the political manoeuvres and theoretical ruminations of Indian radicals during the last thirty years of the liberation movement … [The] book is an attempt to interweave a study of the mainstream nationalist movement with not only the trajectory of the Communist Party of India  but that of the Left wing of the Indian National Congress.’ (New Politics  USA)‘It is a welcome addition to the existing literature  both for its comprehensiveness and the discussion its critical conclusions could generate.’  (The Hindu)‘The volume is definitely a significant contribution to the history of the Left movement in India. One would expect Rai Chowdhuri to come out with a successor volume that will cover the history of the communists in India and their transformation  if any at all  up to the present day  especially in the backdrop of Deng Xiaoping’s famous dictum: “To be rich is glorious  that is the Marxism of today.”’ (The Statesman)‘It is necessary to know the early history of the Left in order to make sense of its politics today…this book brings it alive with detailed and objective accounts. The author captures remarkably well the complex milieu in which the communists and other Leftists struggled to find an identity for themselves.’  (The Telegraph)‘The book is a history of the nationalist struggle for decolonisation told from the standpoint of the Left in India  as well as an evaluation of the role of Leftism in this struggle. The result is a useful study of the impact that the communists and the Left wing of the Congress had on each other…. Rai Chowdhuri covers in great detail M.N. Roy’s role in introducing ideas of Marxism in India  Jawaharlal Nehru’s encounter with Fabian socialism  the emergence of working-class parties in urban centres and the Congress socialists’ resolve to stay within the Congress but fight for radical socio-economic changes. The very fact that this is a history that looks at different aspects of Leftism in India together must be welcomed.’  (Economic and Political Weekly)‘This is a useful reference book that highlights a rather neglected but a significant aspect of Indian politics in the early 20th century. Indeed  by tracing the origin of the Left movement in the era of the national Independence struggle  the author demonstrates how and why the Left movement came to acquire the shape it had in an Independent India.’ (Journal of Asian and African Studies (SAGE Publications))‘This may well be the ultimate work on Indian Leftists covering a tumultuous period—from when Lenin seized power in Russia in 1917 to when India gained freedom in 1947.’ (Indo-Asian News Service) 				    	 					 About the Author Satyabrata Rai Chowdhuri  PhD  DLitt (1935–2016)  was a renowned political scientist of his times  specializing in South Asian politics and international relations. He taught at various government colleges in West Bengal early in his career before joining Rabindra Bharati University in Kolkata where he held a long stint as a Professor and the Head of the Department of Political Science. In 2000  the University Grants Commission conferred on him the Emeritus Fellowship. Professor Rai Chowdhuri also lectured on Indian politics at the University of Oxford and was a Senior Fellow in International Relations at the Institute of Commonwealth Studies  University of London. In 2006  he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland. A prolific writer  he was a commentator and columnist on South Asian politics with several esteemed publications across the globe. His other recent book is Nuclear Politics: Towards a Safer World."

"The Secret of the Druids (Mahabharata Quest Series Book 2) Review Christopher with this installment has seriously convinced me that He is an Indian Author who requires to be read . I have read all his previous work and also admitting that writing historical fiction is always controversial when compared to mainstream views. What Christopher has done with this latest book   has extended the knowledge that existed in the ancient world already . In fact having researched ancient Sanskrit texts for a long time   what Christopher has come up with on this book   is not just simple fiction   but the Historical connection as per what the known and shared knowledge was . The plot is racy   pages will flip past before you already know which happened to me. This guy proves   History matters and knowing history connects all of us ! Excellent read .

"Thinking  Fast and Slow Review “A tour de force. . . Kahneman's book is a must read for anyone interested in either human behavior or investing. He clearly shows that while we like to think of ourselves as rational in our decision making  the truth is we are subject to many biases. At least being aware of them will give you a better chance of avoiding them  or at least making fewer of them.” ―Larry Swedroe  CBS News“Daniel Kahneman demonstrates forcefully in his new book  Thinking  Fast and Slow  how easy it is for humans to swerve away from rationality.” ―Christopher Shea  The Washington Post“An outstanding book  distinguished by beauty and clarity of detail  precision of presentation and gentleness of manner. Its truths are open to all those whose System 2 is not completely defunct. I have hardly touched on its richness.” ―Galen Strawson  The Guardian“Brilliant . . . It is impossible to exaggerate the importance of Daniel Kahneman's contribution to the understanding of the way we think and choose. He stands among the giants  a weaver of the threads of Charles Darwin  Adam Smith and Sigmund Freud. Arguably the most important psychologist in history  Kahneman has reshaped cognitive psychology  the analysis of rationality and reason  the understanding of risk and the study of happiness and well-being . . . A magisterial work  stunning in its ambition  infused with knowledge  laced with wisdom  informed by modesty and deeply humane. If you can read only one book this year  read this one.” ―Janice Gross Stein  The Globe and Mail“A sweeping  compelling tale of just how easily our brains are bamboozled  bringing in both his own research and that of numerous psychologists  economists  and other experts...Kahneman has a remarkable ability to take decades worth of research and distill from it what would be important and interesting for a lay audience...Thinking  Fast and Slow is an immensely important book. Many science books are uneven  with a useful or interesting chapter too often followed by a dull one. Not so here. With rare exceptions  the entire span of this weighty book is fascinating and applicable to day-to-day life. Everyone should read Thinking  Fast and Slow.” ―Jesse Singal  Boston Globe“We must be grateful to Kahneman for giving us in this book a joyful understanding of the practical side of our personalities.” ―Freeman Dyson  The New York Review of Books“Brilliant . . . It is impossible to exaggerate the importance of Daniel Kahneman's contribution to the understanding of the way we think and choose. He stands among the giants  a weaver of the threads of Charles Darwin  Adam Smith and Sigmund Freud. Arguably the most important psychologist in history  Kahneman has reshaped cognitive psychology  the analysis of rationality and reason  the understanding of risk and the study of happiness and well-being . . . A magisterial work  stunning in its ambition  infused with knowledge  laced with wisdom  informed by modesty and deeply humane. If you can read only one book this year  read this one.” ―Janice Gross Stein  The Globe and Mail“It is an astonishingly rich book: lucid  profound  full of intellectual surprises and self-help value. It is consistently entertaining and frequently touching  especially when Kahneman is recounting his collaboration with Tversky . . . So impressive is its vision of flawed human reason that the New York Times columnist David Brooks recently declared that Kahneman and Tversky's work ‘will be remembered hundreds of years from now ' and that it is ‘a crucial pivot point in the way we see ourselves.' They are  Brooks said  ‘like the Lewis and Clark of the mind' . . . By the time I got to the end of Thinking  Fast and Slow  my skeptical frown had long since given way to a grin of intellectual satisfaction. Appraising the book by the peak-end rule  I overconfidently urge everyone to buy and read it. But for those who are merely interested in Kahenman's takeaway on the Malcolm Gladwell question it is this: If you've had 10 000 hours of training in a predictable  rapid-feedback environment--chess  firefighting  anesthesiology--then blink. In all other cases  think.” ―The New York Times Book Review“Ask around and you hear pretty much the same thing. 'Kahneman is the most influential psychologist since Sigmund Freud ' says Christopher Chabris  a professor of psychology at Union College  in New York. 'No one else has had such a broad impact on so many fields' . . . It now seems inevitable that Kahneman  who made his reputation by ignoring or defying conventional wisdom  is about to be anointed the intellectual guru of our economically irrational times.” ―Evan R. Goldstein  The Chronicle of Higher Education“There have been many good books on human rationality and irrationality  but only one masterpiece. That masterpiece is Daniel Kahneman's Thinking  Fast and Slow . . . This is one of the greatest and most engaging collections of insights into the human mind I have read.” ―William Easterly  Financial Times“[Thinking  Fast and Slow] is wonderful  of course. To anyone with the slightest interest in the workings of his own mind  it is so rich and fascinating that any summary would seem absurd.” ―Michael Lewis  Vanity Fair“Absorbingly articulate and infinitely intelligent . . . What's most enjoyable and compelling about Thinking  Fast and Slow is that it's so utterly  refreshingly anti-Gladwellian. There is nothing pop about Kahneman's psychology  no formulaic story arc  no beating you over the head with an artificial  buzzword-encrusted Big Idea. It's just the wisdom that comes from five decades of honest  rigorous scientific work  delivered humbly yet brilliantly  in a way that will forever change the way you think about thinking.” ―Maria Popova  The Atlantic“I will never think about thinking quite the same. [Thinking  Fast and Slow] is a monumental achievement.” ―Roger Lowenstein  Bloomberg/Businessweek“Profound . . . As Copernicus removed the Earth from the centre of the universe and Darwin knocked humans off their biological perch  Mr. Kahneman has shown that we are not the paragons of reason we assume ourselves to be.” ―The Economist“[Kahneman's] disarmingly simple experiments have profoundly changed the way that we think about thinking . . . We like to see ourselves as a Promethean species  uniquely endowed with the gift of reason. But Mr. Kahneman's simple experiments reveal a very different mind  stuffed full of habits that  in most situations  lead us astray.” ―Jonah Lehrer  The Wall Street Journal“[A] tour de force of psychological insight  research explication and compelling narrative that brings together in one volume the high points of Mr. Kahneman's notable contributions  over five decades  to the study of human judgment  decision-making and choice . . . Thanks to the elegance and force of his ideas  and the robustness of the evidence he offers for them  he has helped us to a new understanding of our divided minds--and our whole selves.” ―Christoper F. Chabris  The Wall Street Journal“The ramifications of Kahenman's work are wide  extending into education  business  marketing  politics . . . and even happiness research. Call his field ""psychonomics "" the hidden reasoning behind our choices. Thinking  Fast and Slow is essential reading for anyone with a mind.” ―Kyle Smith  The New York Post“A major intellectual event . . . The work of Kahneman and Tversky was a crucial pivot point in the way we see ourselves.” ―David Brooks  The New York Times“Kahneman provides a detailed  yet accessible  description of the psychological mechanisms involved in making decisions.” ―Jacek Debiec  Nature“With Kahneman's expert help  readers may understand this mix of psychology and economics better than most accountants  therapists  or elected representatives. VERDICT A stellar accomplishment  a book for everyone who likes to think and wants to do it better.” ―Library Journal“The mind is a hilariously muddled compromise between incompatible modes of thought in this fascinating treatise by a giant in the field of decision research. Nobel-winning psychologist Kahneman (Attention and Effort) posits a brain governed by two clashing decision-making processes. The largely unconscious System 1  he contends  makes intuitive snap judgments based on emotion  memory  and hard-wired rules of thumb

"Circe Review Named one of the 'Best Books of 2018' by NPR  The Washington Post  Buzzfeed  People  Time  Amazon  Entertainment Weekly  Bustle  Newsweek  the A.V. Club  Christian Science Monitor  Southern Living  and Refinery 29.  ""Circe ' [is] a bold and subversive retelling of the goddess's story that manages to be both epic and intimate in its scope  recasting the most infamous female figure from the Odyssey as a hero in her own right.""―Alexandra Alter  New York Times""One of the most amazing qualities of this novel [is]: We know how everything here turns out - we've known it for thousands of years - and yet in Miller's lush reimagining  the story feels harrowing and unexpected. The feminist light she shines on these events never distorts their original shape  it only illuminates details we hadn't noticed before.""―Ron Charles  Washington Post""[Miller] gives voice to Circe as a multifaceted and evolving character...'Circe' is very pleasurable to read  combining lively versions of familiar tales and snippets of other  related standards with a highly psychologized  redemptive and ultimately exculpatory account of the protagonist herself.""―Claire Messud  New York Times Book Review""The story of Circe's entanglement with Odysseus lasts far beyond the narrative of ""The Odyssey "" making for compelling material to revisit. But ultimately it's as a character that Circe stands apart....Through her elegant  psychologically acute prose  Miller gives us a rich female character who inhabits the spaces in between.""―Colleen Abel  Minneapolis Star Tribune""Miller's lush  gold-lit novel - told from the perspective of the witch whose name in Greek has echoes of a hawk and a weaver's shuttle - paints another picture: of a fierce goddess who  yes  turns men into pigs  but only because they deserve it.""―NPR.org ""so vivid  so layered  you could get lost in it... Whether or not you think you like Greek Mythology  this is just great storytelling. It feels cinematic.""― NPR's Here & Now""Spellbinding..Miller has created a daring feminist take on a classic narrative  although the setting is a mystical world of gods  monsters  and nymphs  the protagonist at its heart is like any of us.""―O Magazine""Miller's spell builds slowly  but by the last page you'll be in awe. In prose of dreamlike simplicity  she reimagines the myth of Circe.""―People""Miller  with her academic bona fides and born instinct for storytelling  seamlessly grafts modern concepts of selfhood and independence to her mystical reveries of smoke and silver  nectar and bones.""―Entertainment Weekly About the Author Madeline Miller was born in Boston and attended Brown University where she earned her BA and MA in Classics. She lives in Narbeth  PA with her husband and two children. The Song of Achilles was awarded the Orange Prize for Fiction and has been translated into twenty-five languages."

"There's No Such Thing as Business Ethics: There's Only One Rule for Making Decisions About the Author John C. Maxwell lives in Atlanta  Georgia 				    	 					 From AudioFile The author of THINKING FOR A CHANGE and THE 21 IRREFUTABLE LAWS OF LEADERSHIP uses his friendly baritone voice and moral groundedness to offer a classic lesson: Morality at work is no different from morality anywhere else  if you base your actions on the Platinum Rule  which is to treat others BETTER than you want to be treated yourself. With fresh-sounding aphorisms  history lessons  and stories from contemporary business life  Maxwell sells this simple idea with a personal authority that contains no smugness or conceit. His generous spirit and security with himself open the ear and heart to an audio lesson that should never go out of fashion.

"The Argumentative Indian: Writings on Indian History  Culture and Identity Review ""India  going back for generations  has offered us masterful political  philosophic and economic commentary. That grace endures  and Amartya Sen is now its leading contributor. Nothing  whether from India or from the world at large  could surpass the essays in The Argumentative Indian. As will many others  I endorse this book for all."" --John Kenneth Galbraith ""Sen denounces--and indeed disproves--the bigoted view that reason is essentially Western or European. India  he makes plain  has a long tradition of civil debate  of secular thought and of contributions to math and science. The opening essays are broadly historical  but Sen moves on to issues of greater relevance and urgency...Collections of previously published essays often prove uneven  this one is remarkably uniform in theme and quality...ultimately revelatory."" --Kirkus Reviews""Of the stream of eloquent Indians who have enlivened modern intellectual life...Amartya Sen is perhaps the most versatile and most determinedly argumentative...His present collection is a bracing sweep through aspects of Indian history and culture  and a tempered analysis of the highly charged disputes surrounding these subjects - the nature of Hindu traditions  Indian identity  the country's huge social and economic disparities  and its current place in the world ...If ever there was a global intellectual  it is Sen...his true distinctiveness becomes clear when seen against the background of two [rich] historical traditions: ...of classical political economy  and of social criticism and reform: the call and response of British liberal imperialism and Indian cosmopolitan nationalism... Sen wants us to notice the strong individuality of [Indian] culture...but his view of India is also critical. His essays take unsparing measure of India's social and economic problems...Although Sen is free with his judgments  his writing maintains a coolly embattled tone  as well as an unfailing  old-style courtesy...[He] is a distinguished inheritor of the tradition of public philosophy and reasoning - Roy  Tagore  Gandhi  Nehru."" --Sunil Khilnani  Financial Times""Mr. Sen's interests...extend far beyond the work that won him the Nobel...The 16 chapters range from an appreciation of Rabindranath Tagore  a great poet of Mr. Sen's native Bengal  to an examination of the historic intellectual links between India and China  to a discussion of India's wealth of sophisticated calendars... Mr. Sen shows that the argumentative gene is not just a part of India's make-up that cannot be wished away. It is an essential part of its survival - and an advantage.""--The Economist""Sen is unquestionably one of the most distinguished minds of our time . . . Yet while the pieces here are  as one would expect  enjoyably erudite and full of intriguing insights  they are not written in acadamese...Instead  the book is formed from a series of elegantly written historical and philosophical essays which cohere to form a single argument: that the sheer diversity of views and faiths and competing ideas that have always coexisted in India has naturally led to a fecund and tolerant argumentative tradition. … profound and stimulating . . . erudite and sophisticated . . . engaging and thought-provoking. The product of such a great mind at the peak of its power  it is one of the most stimulating books about India to be written for years  and it deserves the widest possible readership."" --William Dalrymple  The Sunday Times (London)""EP Thompson once wrote that since 'all the convergent influences of the world'...run through India  'there is not a thought that is being thought in the west or east that is not active in some Indian mind'...It is certainly rare to see them as elegantly synthesised as they are in the cosmopolitan mind of Amartya Sen...His prose is benignly professorial  always measured  and occasionally rises to dry irony...He wants to see how the argumentative tradition in India can be deployed against 'societal inequity and asymmetry' and what actual use can be 'made of the opportunities of democratic articulation and of political engagement'...'Silence is a powerful enemy of social justice ' Sen writes.""--Pankaj Mishra  The Guardian""In this superb collection of essays  Sen smashes quite a few stereotypes and places the idea of India and Indianness in its rightful  deserved context. Central to his notion of India...is the long tradition of argument and public debate  of intellectual pluralism and generosity that informs India's history. One of the book's many triumphs is its tone. Sen does not indulge in triumphalism about his country's past...he propounds a view of Hinduism as an inclusive philosophy rather than an exclusionist  divisive religion. This view of Hinduism is mature enough and magnanimous enough to accommodate dissenting views and 'even profound skepticism.'...This is a book that needed to have been written. The perception of India in the West and  indeed  among Indians themselves has never been more amorphous as it is now. The Argumentative Indian will provide a new dimension and perspective to that perception. It would be no surprise if it were to become as defining and influential a work as Edward Said's Orientalism."" --Soumya Bhattacharya  The Observer (London) About the Author Amartya Sen is Lamont University Professor at Harvard. He won the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1998 and was Master of Trinity College  Cambridge  1998–2004.

He was the oldest son of a rice farmer who was also the local mayor. Fukuoka studied plant pathology and worked for number of years as a produce inspector in the customs office in Yokohama. But in 1938 he returned to his village home determined to put his ideas about natural farming into practice. During World War II  he worked for the Japanese government as a researcher on food production  managing to avoid military service until the final few months of the war. After the war  he returned to Shikoku to devote himself wholeheartedly to farming. And in 1975  distressed by the effects of Japan’s post-war modernization  Fukuoka wrote The One-Straw Revolution. In his later years  Fukuoka was involved with several projects to reduce desertification throughout the world. He remained an active farmer until well into his eighties  and continued to give lectures until only a few years before his death at the age of ninety-five. Fukuoka is also the author of The Natural Way of Farming and The Road Back to Nature. In 1988 he received the Magsaysay Award for Public Service.Frances Moore Lappé is author or co-author of sixteen books  including Diet for a Small Planet and Getting a Grip: Clarity  Creativity  and Courage in a World Gone Mad.

Now that I have  there’s no going back. “ (Geneen Roth  author of Women Food and God)“Hendricks provides a clear path for achieving our true potential and attaining not only financial success but also success in love and life.” (OfSpirit.com)“Hendricks has the answers.” (Elevated Existence) 				    	 					 From the Back Cover Most of us believe that we will finally feel satisfied and content with our lives when we get the good news we have been waiting for  find a healthy relationship  or achieve one of our personal goals. However  this rarely happens. Good fortune is often followed by negative emotions that overtake us and result in destructive behaviors. ""I don't deserve this "" ""this is too good to be true "" or any number of harmful thought patterns prevent us from experiencing the joy and satisfaction we have earned. Sound familiar? This is what New York Times bestselling author Gay Hendricks calls the Upper Limit Problem  a negative emotional reaction that occurs when anything positive enters our lives. The Upper Limit Problem not only prevents happiness  but it actually stops us from achieving our goals. It is the ultimate life roadblock. In The Big Leap  Hendricks reveals a simple yet comprehensive program for overcoming this barrier to happiness and fulfillment  presented in a way that engages both the mind and heart. Working closely with more than one thousand extraordinary achievers in business and the arts—from rock stars to Fortune 500 executives—whose stories are featured in these pages  the book describes the four hidden fears that are at the root of the Upper Limit Problem.The Big Leap delivers a proven method for first identifying which of these four fears prevents us from reaching our personal upper limit  and then breaking through that limitation to achieve what Hendricks refers to as our Zone of Genius. Hendricks provides a clear path for achieving our true potential and attaining not only financial success but also success in love and life.              See all Product description"

"Euclid's Window: The Story of Geometry from Parallel Lines to Hyperspace Amazon.com Review ""How do you know where you are?"" asks Leonard Mlodinow in his charming mathematical history  Euclid's Window. This question and others about space and time grew out of simple observations of the environment by a select group of thinkers whose lives and brains Mlodinow dissects. Starting with Euclid  geometry has flowed out over the centuries  describing the universe  and  Mlodinow argues  making modern civilization possible. This is not just a history of geometry--it's a timeline of reason and abstraction  with all the major players present: Euclid  Descartes  Gauss  Einstein  and Witten  each represented by a minibiography.  Lots of examples pepper the narrative to help readers achieve their own ""eureka!"" And it's impossible not to be staggered at the mathematical feats of these geniuses  accomplished as many of them were in the absence of anything but observation and intense thought. Each story builds satisfactorily on the last  until at the end of this delightful book  one has a sense of having climbed a peak of understanding. A working knowledge of basic geometry is helpful but not essential for enjoying Euclid's Window  and Mlodinow's chatty style lends itself remarkably well to explaining these deep and revolutionary concepts. --Adam Fisher  From Booklist Mlodinow's spry account of geometry stresses the stature of the greatest math book of all time  Euclid's Elements. Although the three-dimensional space he described in it doesn't truly represent the shape of nature  Euclid compensated by codifying an attitude essential to rational thinking--to wit  distrust intuition and therefore don't accept unjustified assumptions. Unfortunately  Euclid himself made one unjustified assumption  the parallel postulate  which worked fine in the flat-Earth mathematical world that existed until Carl Friedrich Gauss dismantled it in the nineteenth century. Gauss invented a new geometry of curved or hyperbolic space  a feat that Mlodinow honors in such amusing asides as his remark on Kant's defense of Euclid: ""Gauss did not dismiss Kant's work out of hand. He read it  then dismissed it."" Such japes lighten and popularize Mlodinow's approach to the further demolition of Euclid by Gauss' student Georg Riemann  whose work critically contributed to the theory of general relativity. Mlodinow's lively exposition concludes with string theorists' claim that geometry possesses no fewer than 11 dimensions. Gilbert TaylorCopyright © American Library Association.

Muhammad The Merciful Muhammad The Merciful The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) is the focus of love and devotion for one fifth of humanity. Even outsiders cannot deny his political genius and great statesmanship as the founder of a new world order and the stimulus for a succession of brilliant and progressive civilisations. But a study of his life in these terms overlooks arguably his most essential qualities – his mercy and benevolence. Internationally renowned Islamic scholar  Dr Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri has produced a work unrivalled in its comprehensive treatment of the subject matter  illustrating the merciful character of the Prophet (peace be upon him) in all its aspects  towards humans and more generally towards all beings. Dr Tahir-ul-Qadri has reproduced a solid corpus of references from the Qur’an  along with reliable Hadith  specially selected for authenticity and relevance. All sources are meticulously referenced in Dr Tahir-ul-Qadri’s characteristic style. This book Muhammad The Merciful shows how in spite of immense hardships and painful ordeals  the mercy and compassion of the Prophet (peace be upon him) remained to the fore  even towards those who opposed and persecuted him. For Muslims  this book will be a means to celebrate the magnanimous personality of the Prophet (peace be upon him) and an incentive to instil the great qualities of the Prophet (peace be upon him) in their own lives  while non-Muslims and academics will discover how these qualities as described in the Islamic literature have caused the Prophet (peace be upon him) to occupy his preeminent position in the religious consciousness of Muslims.

"Yoga Spandakarika: The Sacred Texts at the Origins of Tantra Review ""The Yoga Spandakarika helped me realize how my human feelings are key tools to understanding this divinity  and that the Divine can be as close as a shiver of joy."" (Gef Temblay  Ascent  Issue 27) 				    	 					 From the Back Cover EASTERN RELIGION / HINDUISMThe Spandakarika  or Song of the Sacred Tremor  is one of the most important Tantric texts in the tradition of Kashmiri Shaivism. In fact  it is said to have been transmitted directly to the sage Vasugupta from the hands of Shiva on Mount Kailas. In his commentary on these fifty-two stanzas  the sage Ksemaraja described them as the heart of the Mahamudra  the Great Cosmic Gesture. In Yoga Spandakarika Daniel Odier presents a full translation of the song accompanied by his own commentary and the commentary of more than thirty Tantric masters.The oldest masters of Spandakarika viewed everything in the universe  including matter  as consciousness and created a yoga practice in accordance with this realization. The sacred dance of Yoga Spandakarika  Tandava  is extremely subtle and difficult  requiring thousands of hours of practice to master  yet it surpasses any other physical practice  allowing the practitioner to touch the divine inner pulse. Once its third stage has been mastered  the yogi or yogini is able to manifest the dance of Shiva in space  a tradition visible in the statuary of Tantric temples in India and Tibet. Energy is no longer contracted by the perception of duality  and the mind and body become unbounded  forming a sphere that contains all that was formerly outside. In Yoga Spandakarika Daniel Odier passes on these vanishing teachings as he received them from his Tibetan master  Kalu Rinpoche  and Kashmiri yogini Lalita Devi. In addition to his translation of the Spandakarika  Odier includes a complete translation of the Vijnanabhairava Tantra  the oldest source text on yoga.DANIEL ODIER began his studies with Kalu Rinpoche in 1968 and remained a disciple of the master until his passing in 1989. In 2004 Odier received the Ch'an ordination in the Lin t'si and Caodong schools in China as well as the transmission of the Zhao Zhou Ch'an lineage in the Xu Yun (Empty Cloud) tradition. He gives workshops in Europe  Canada  and the United States and is the author of Meditation Techniques of the Buddhist and Taoist Masters  Desire: The Tantric Path to Awakening  and Tantric Quest.

"Accessory to War – The Unspoken Alliance Between Astrophysics and the Military Review Extraordinary....A feast of history  an expert tour through thousands of years of war and conquest....Condenses multiple bodies of work into one important  comprehensive and coherent story of the symbiotic developments of astrophysics and war....The lesson is not merely a wake-up call for astrophysicists  but for all of us  for anyone with the misapprehension that science somehow marches on separate from the rest of culture — Jennifer Carson (New York Times Book Review)Through ample research and nimble storytelling  Tyson and [Lang] trace the long and tangled relationship between state power and astronomy....Deep and eloquent. — Joshua Sokol (Washington Post)Fascinating....Retells the history of space exploration  and of the Cold War  excelling in bringing forth the entangled advances of science and military interests....The book’s message rings like a wake-up call. — Marcelo Gleiser (NPR)Archimedes and Leonardo worked for their Departments of Defense  and when the telescope was invented it was an immediate instrument of war. Why do astrophysicists even have jobs? asks Neil deGrasse Tyson. Now you can see the inside story  from early times to the cold war  the Apollo program  spy satellites and the Hubble Space Telescope  the Iraq war  and perhaps asteroid mining. A wonderful book and a fascinating read  full of amazing stories  all backed up with deep scholarship. — John Mather  Winner of the Nobel Prize in PhysicsA sweeping panoramic overview of the enduring alliance between astrophysics and the military—from the Greeks to Galileo to GPS. — ScienceAccessory to War is a phenomenal work that should be required reading for policy makers everywhere. — William E. Burrows  author of Deep Black: Space Espionage and National Security and This New Ocean: The Story of the First Space AgeThis is an indispensable  mind-blowing account about a necessary near-future that is  tragically  not inevitable: that the disciplines of astrophysics and politics unite to forge a new frontier—not through ‘Rumsfeldian-Trumpian truculence ’ or by fattening the military while now starving science and the humanities  or by allowing China to continue to lead the U.S. in ‘worldwide research and development spending.’ These have already killed a supposed American Century. Beautifully combining a clear account of cutting-edge astrophysics and politics with a 3000-year historical perspective  this book deserves not only to be read  but to become a guide for those who hope for a better  survivable  near future. — Walter LaFeber  Tisch Distinguished University Professor Emeritus  Cornell UniversityThroughout history  wars tend to be won by nations that are at the forefront of science. Thus astronomers and physicists have  since ancient times  benefited from an uneasy alliance with the military. This enlightening book explores the history and current implications of this partnership between space science and national security. — Walter Isaacson  author of Steve Jobs and professor of history  Tulane UniversityAccessory to War is not just about astrophysics. It is a readable account of the intersection between science and security policy  complete with historical background and personal insights and anecdotes from America’s most-trusted scientist. This is a much needed read for both policymakers and the public  who in 'normal' times know and care too little about science  but in today's political climate increasingly show disdain for scientific principles that fail to fit their philosophical reality or political goals. Astrophysics is too often perceived as 'not touching me or my life ' but this book artfully explains otherwise. — Joan Johnson-Freese  professor of national security affairs  Naval War CollegeA wide ranging and provocative set of observations on the two-way relationship between science-based knowledge and national power  especially power of the military variety  replete with trenchant insights. Tyson and Lang’s hopeful concluding message is on-target—that knowledge-based dominance  either in space or on Earth  is not possible in today’s interconnected world  and that cooperation in the use of our knowledge is the necessary path to planetary well-being. — John M. Logsdon  professor emeritus  Space Policy Institute  George Washington University 				    	 					 About the Author Neil deGrasse Tyson is an astrophysicist with the American Museum of Natural History  director of its world-famous Hayden Planetarium  host of the hit radio and TV show StarTalk  and the New York Times best-selling author of Astrophysics for People in a Hurry.

The Book of Saladin: A Novel (The Islam Quintet) Amazon.com Review Tariq Ali has been a British national treasure for almost five decades. Revolutionary  writer  broadcaster  filmmaker  polemicist--fighter in the street--and general all-round trouble-maker (in the nicest possible sense)  he's been them all  and usually at the same time. Since 1990 Ali has also worked in fiction  firstly with Redemption  and now with a planned quartet of historical novels  of which The Book of Saladin is the second. (The first was the award-winning Shadows of the Pomegranate Tree.)  Ali's passion for life  and his humor  are found all over this latest work  which is set in the 12th century--with eerily prescient echoes of modern times. It shows us the conflict between Christian and Islamic civilizations set to a sometimes bawdy  sometimes brutal background where all of life is in flux. As in his previous novel  Ali shows the depth and breadth of his learning and humanity on every page. Like his central character  Saladin  or Salah-al-Din (the Kurdish liberator of Jerusalem)  he has been a fighter of many causes  a maker of alliances  who has made an impact on the world around him. Unlike his hero  Tariq Ali has never been a Sultan  or a warrior  except a class one  of course. But between them--Ali and his warrior king--readers can discover much of both history and contemporary life in the melting pot of world religion. --Robin Hunt  Amazon.co.uk  Review “The Book of Saladin is the second in a quartet of novels by Tariq Ali on the long encounter between Western Christendom and the world of Islam. Grippingly well told  brilliantly paced  remarkably convincing in its historical depiction of a fateful relationship  it is a narrative for our time  haunted by distant events and characters who are closer to us than we had dreamed.”—Edward Said“Ali overturns demonising stereotypes of Salah-al-Din  portraying instead the 'barbarian' Western invaders. Whether depicting erotically charged harem intrigue or siege warfare  The Book of Saladin is an entertaining feat of revisionist storytelling.”—Simon Carnell  Sunday Times“Ali’s new historical novel ... is told in a manner which combines the incantatory storytelling of the great Middle Eastern anthologies with the solidarity of historical research.”—Philip Hensher  Mail on Sunday“Fiercely lyrical. Weaving political intrigue  gay and straight love  betrayal  cross-dressing  rape  assassination and crimes of passion  Ali's tale ripples with implicit parallels to our age.”—Publishers Weekly               See all Product description

You will also learn how to trust yourself on the court and how to maintain clarity of mind throughout the match  giving you a clear psychological advantage over your opponent.

I love it because it’s so much bigger than soccer. I Am Zlatan is a story of hope and grit and what an immigrant kid who comes from nothing can accomplish with hard work and belief in himself.

"Vision for Life  Revised Edition: Ten Steps to Natural Eyesight Improvement Review “In this generous book  Meir Schneider shares the secrets—won through his own movingly documented triumph over near-blindness—of strengthening  rejuvenating  and healing the eyes by activating the body’s own intelligence. A man of vision in every sense  he offers a program of exercises that is both inspiring and eminently practicable.”―Timothy Crouse  author of The Boys on the Bus   “I have been impressed with the work of Meir Schneider for many years  having personally seen improvements in patients’ vision of those who have worked with him. The ability of the visual system to adapt and regain function is still full of mysteries. Through Meir’s work  we are finding some of those mysteries to be realities.”―August L. Reader III  MD  FACS  clinical professor of ophthalmology  California Pacific Medical Center“This book isn’t just another useful handbook for those who want to prevent vision problems or already have a condition  it is also an injection of hope.”―Sônia Cristina Tinós Carrocine  instructor of Meir Schneider’s Self-Healing Method“As an ophthalmologist  I always search for the best way to treat my patients. Based on the Bates Method  self-healing has complemented my practice in those cases where our traditional medicine has its limitations. The best treatment is the one that is directed to the patient’s needs  and the best medicine is the one that uses all knowledge and not only a part of it. Traditional science and complementary medicine are tools that should be used together  focusing on a more holistic health concept.”―Leonardo Verri Paulino  MD  ophthalmologist and anterior segment surgeon at ABC Medical School  Brazil“Meir’s method is effective as a complementary physical therapy for the eyes.”―Emília Ritsuko Yasuoka Assad  ophthalmologist and acupuncturist “Working with my patients has veriﬁed that many sight problems get better and heal by taking up the right habits. Meir presents us with a complete guide to do so. He helps us to regain our trust in the power we have over our vision and our lives. As he says in the book  ‘We all can take the time. We just have to decide that we are worth the time and that the process is worth our while.’” ―Amelia Salvador  ophthalmologist  Spain “It is wonderful how each new book by Meir Schneider provokes us to incorporate more and more of the self-healing principles into our lives.”—Laercio Motoryn  MD  ophthalmologist and homeopath “I had the pleasure to meet Meir Schneider and use his method when I was finishing my apprenticeship to become a Bachelor of Optometry in 2005. His holistic approach toward visual dysfunctions changed me forever as a professional. His concepts remain present in my appointments  therapies  and lens prescriptions. Meir’s work invites us to naturally preserve our organism and to practice healthier visual habits in this very technological world.”—Fernando Nassif  optometrist with specialization in orthoptics and visual therapy “The knowledge and application of the Self-Healing Method was very important to improve my practice as an ophthalmologist. The results attained by my patients and with my own vision are proof of the importance of the union of traditional medicine with complementary therapies. I thank Meir for being such a marvelous instrument for my personal and professional improvement.”—Ana Cecilia Gois Franco  ophthalmologist and anterior segment surgeon and naturopath  São Paulo  Brazil 				    	 					 About the Author Named one of the ten most inspirational people of Israel by a top national Israeli news program  Meir Schneider is the founder and head teacher of the School for Self-Healing in San Francisco  which offers programs that satisfy the continuing education requirements of the American Massage Therapy Association (AMTA) and the National Certification Board for Therapeutic Massage and Bodywork (NCBTMB).

2G SAGA Unfolds Institutional governance is the bedrock of Indian policy making and enforcement under our fundamental constitutional tenet of ‘we the people’. Such governance relies on harmonious administrative protocols with amicable adherence amongst all the stake-holders. The 2G issue  as it was investigated  audited  charged and adjudicated by the various statutory and constitutional bodies (CVC  CAG  CBI and the Supreme Court) flouted these precepts of harmony and amicableness. The aberrant process resulted in the violation not only of democratic values but also the rights and reputations of various individuals thus tarnishing our country’s image on the international stage. It was an attempt to allege guilt of ‘corruption’ as defined by Transparency International (TI) i.e. “Manipulation of policies in the allocation of resources.” Yet  A. Raja had established that their findings and observations were diametrically opposite to the decisions of the Cabinet  Parliament  Planning Commission and Telecom Regulator (TRAI). The purpose of this book is to caution the masses that personal motivations  institutional incompetency  misunderstanding or misguidance should not hurriedly endorsed without diligent inspection. Government bodies are accountable to – and empowered by the people – and in the end “all power is trust.” The author demonstrates here that the ‘2G scam’ is a shameful blemish on the sanctity of the administrative system of our country. ABOUT THE AUTHOR Andimuthu Raja (b. 1963) educated in Madras University and Madurai Kamaraj University  was motivated by Tamil literature which had attracted him to Dravidian ideology promoted and propagated by Periyar E.V. Ramasamy  Founder of the Dravidar Kazhagam (DK)  a social reform movement. In 1983  his collection of Tamil poems was published under the title Oru Suya Sarithai. In 1983  he joined the student wing of DMK  a political party emerged from DK. In 1988.

"The Black Swan: Second Edition: The Impact of the Highly Improbable: With a new section: ""On Robustness and Fragility"" (Incerto) Amazon.com Review Bestselling author Nassim Nicholas Taleb continues his exploration of randomness in his fascinating new book  The Black Swan  in which he examines the influence of highly improbable and unpredictable events that have massive impact. Engaging and enlightening  The Black Swan is a book that may change the way you think about the world  a book that Chris Anderson calls  ""a delightful romp through history  economics  and the frailties of human nature."" See Anderson's entire guest review below.  Guest Reviewer: Chris AndersonChris Anderson is editor-in-chief of Wired magazine and the author of The Long Tail: Why the Future of Business Is Selling Less of More.  Four hundred years ago  Francis Bacon warned that our minds are wired to deceive us. ""Beware the fallacies into which undisciplined thinkers most easily fall--they are the real distorting prisms of human nature."" Chief among them: ""Assuming more order than exists in chaotic nature."" Now consider the typical stock market report: ""Today investors bid shares down out of concern over Iranian oil production."" Sigh. We're still doing it. Our brains are wired for narrative  not statistical uncertainty. And so we tell ourselves simple stories to explain complex thing we don't--and  most importantly  can't--know. The truth is that we have no idea why stock markets go up or down on any given day  and whatever reason we give is sure to be grossly simplified  if not flat out wrong. Nassim Nicholas Taleb first made this argument in Fooled by Randomness  an engaging look at the history and reasons for our predilection for self-deception when it comes to statistics. Now  in The Black Swan: the Impact of the Highly Improbable  he focuses on that most dismal of sciences  predicting the future. Forecasting is not just at the heart of Wall Street  but its something each of us does every time we make an insurance payment or strap on a seat belt. The problem  Nassim explains  is that we place too much weight on the odds that past events will repeat (diligently trying to follow the path of the ""millionaire next door "" when unrepeatable chance is a better explanation). Instead  the really important events are rare and unpredictable. He calls them Black Swans  which is a reference to a 17th century philosophical thought experiment. In Europe all anyone had ever seen were white swans  indeed  ""all swans are white"" had long been used as the standard example of a scientific truth. So what was the chance of seeing a black one? Impossible to calculate  or at least they were until 1697  when explorers found Cygnus atratus in Australia. Nassim argues that most of the really big events in our world are rare and unpredictable  and thus trying to extract generalizable stories to explain them may be emotionally satisfying  but it's practically useless. September 11th is one such example  and stock market crashes are another. Or  as he puts it  ""History does not crawl  it jumps."" Our assumptions grow out of the bell-curve predictability of what he calls ""Mediocristan "" while our world is really shaped by the wild powerlaw swings of ""Extremistan."" In full disclosure  I'm a long admirer of Taleb's work and a few of my comments on drafts found their way into the book. I  too  look at the world through the powerlaw lens  and I too find that it reveals how many of our assumptions are wrong. But Taleb takes this to a new level with a delightful romp through history  economics  and the frailties of human nature. --Chris Anderson  From Booklist In business and government  major money is spent on prediction. Uselessly  according to Taleb  who administers a severe thrashing to MBA- and Nobel Prize-credentialed experts who make their living from economic forecasting. A financial trader and current rebel with a cause  Taleb is mathematically oriented and alludes to statistical concepts that underlie models of prediction  while his expressive energy is expended on roller-coaster passages  bordering on gleeful diatribes  on why experts are wrong. They neglect Taleb's metaphor of ""the black swan "" whose discovery invalidated the theory that all swans are white. Taleb rides this manifestation of the unpredicted event into a range of phenomena  such as why a book becomes a best-seller or how an entrepreneur becomes a billionaire  taking pit stops with philosophers who have addressed the meaning of the unexpected and confounding. Taleb projects a strong presence here that will tempt outside-the-box thinkers into giving him a look. Gilbert TaylorCopyright © American Library Association.

"Circe: The Sunday Times Bestseller Review Circe gives us a feminist slant on the Odyssey ... Miller makes these age-old texts thrum with contemporary relevance ... An airy delight  a novel to be gobbled greedily in a single sitting * Observer * Enough magic  enchantment  voyages and wonders to satisfy the most jaded sword-and-sorcery palate. Miller approaches Odysseus's story from Circe's point of view  richly evoking her protagonist's overlapping identities as goddess  witch  lover and mother -- Adam Roberts * Guardian  Books of the Year * Circe back as superwoman ... Homer's witch get a kickass modern makeover... Miller's Me Too-era  kickass portrait of a woman trying to defy the men and Fates arrayed against her is enchanting... Blisteringly modern * The Times * In a thrilling tour de force of imagination  Miller makes her otherworldly heroine a complex  sympathetic figure for whom we cheer throughout. Circe is a truly spellbinding novel  the mesmerising shimmer of ancient magic rising from it like a heat haze * Mail on Sunday * A brilliantly strange work of mythic science fiction  as effortlessly expressive within the palaces of gods as it is about the world below ... Superb ... This is both a fabulous novel and a fascinating retelling  the best compliment  perhaps  that any myth could hope for * Daily Telegraph * A triumph * The Times  Books of the Year * Circe is poised to become the literary sensation of the summer  as much for the quality of its writing as its timeliness * Sunday Times Magazine * This year's novels were filled with the angry clamour of women's voices: ignored  idealistic or excitingly ambivalent. Madeline Miller reflected the mood for feminist revisionism with her lissom follow-up Circe  which casts the witch goddess in the Odyssey not as a bit player in a man's epic but as the star of her own show -- Claire Allfree * Daily Telegraph  Books of the Year * It was a big year for creative retelling of myth and pre-modern literature  a favourite was Madeline Miller's Circe  a distinctive  lyrical novel about power  agency and reponsibility  from the point of view of this crafty  much-misunderstood goddess -- Emily Wilson * Times Literary Supplement  Books of the Year * The writing is lovely  the tone assured  and the touch just right -- Alexander McCall Smith * Independent  Books of the Year * It is out of these insights that Miller achieves real narrative propulsion ... Supple  pitched in a register that bridges man and myth * Guardian * The first witch in Western literature sets Homer straight as she tells her life story  from her unhappy childhood to her lonely island exile. The woman who emerges is complex and sympathetic. A spellbinding tour de force of imagination * Mail on Sunday  `Sizzling summer reads' * Miller has effected a transformation just as impressive as any of her heroine's own: she's turned an ancient tale of female subjugation into one of empowerment and courage full of contemporary resonances -- Lucy Scholes * Independent * What more could you wish for on holiday than this fabulously written re-imagining of the myth? Gods  monsters and mortals are lushly evoked in a page-turner that is as gripping as a soap opera and which triumphantly fuses myth with our contemporary concerns -- Elizabeth Buchan * Daily Mail  Books of the Summer 2018 * Dubbed the `feminist Odyssey'  there's so much to like about Circe. From the author of the much-loved The Song of Achilles  this novel puts a feminist spin on Greek mythology  recasting Circe  the vilified witch infamous for turning men into pigs  in a sympathetic light. Subverting the usual masculine tropes of epic adventure narratives  Miller tells the story of the women who have been historically silenced. And on top of that  she makes Greek myths and culture  which is often perceived as impenetrable and intimidating  accessible. A real page-turner * Elle Magazine * Illuminates known stories from a new perspective ... Miller has determined  in her characterization of this most powerful witch  to bring her as close as possible to the human  as a thoughtful and compassionate woman who learns to love unselfishly ... A highly psychologized  redemptive and ultimately exculpatory account of the protagonist herself -- Claire Messud * New York Times * The Orange prizewinner Madeline Miller reimagines Circe  the witch from The Odyssey. In Miller's retelling Circe is a suitably bolshie character who is not going to be bossed around by men. The writing is beautiful * The Times * An epic that's also a page-turner * i * Fabulous ... Bold and sensuously written  it plays brilliantly with the original myth of Circe * Daily Mail * I've been waiting for Circe by Madeline Miller for what feels like forever. Since her 2011 debut  The Song of Achilles - a queer retelling of the Iliad from Patroclus' perspective - I've been crowing about the wit and magic of Miller's prose. Circe did not disappoint. It's a feminist tale of the nymph child of Helios  the sun god  who is exiled for practising witchcraft. Circe lives for hundreds of years  encountering heroes  gods and legends  but it never feels like a Greek mythology lesson. Actually  it feels more like a splashy  gossipy memoir written by a celebrity who has met everyone. I suspect this will be my book of the year -- Caroline O'Donoghue * Irish Times * Greek myth is fertile fictional terrain for Miller  who won the Orange Prize with her debut  The Song of Achilles. Her new novel is narrated by Circe  the witch from Homer's Odyssey  who is banished to a remote island and there learns how to survive as a woman alone in the world -- Anita Sethi * Independent  Books of 2018 * A bold and subversive retelling of the goddess's story that manages to be both epic and intimate in its scope  recasting the most infamous female figure from the Odyssey as a hero in her own right * New York Times * The Song of Achilles was a big hit  Circe will be  too * Sunday Times * [Miller] gives voice to Circe as a multifaceted and evolving character ... Circe is very pleasurable to read  combining lively versions of familiar tales and snippets of other  related standards with a highly psychologized  redemptive and ultimately exculpatory account of the protagonist herself * New York Times Book Review * God though she may be  here she faces life - and its love  heartbreak  loneliness and motherhood - with immensely relatable humanity. The definition of female strength in all its fractured  fragile glory * **** Stylist * Offers opportunities for feminist revision of famous characters both mortal and divine  especially the egotistical Odysseus and the irresponsible and laddish Hermes. It also leads to a suspenseful metaphysical dilemma ... Polished diction and descriptive powers * Prospect * Absorbing ... One of the most amazing qualities of this novel [is]: We know how everything here turns out -we've known it for thousands of years - and yet in Miller's lush reimagining  the story feels harrowing and unexpected. The feminist light she shines on these events never distorts their original shape  it only illuminates details we hadn't noticed before... In the story that dawns from Miller's rosy fingers  the fate that awaits Circe is at once divine and mortal  impossibility strange and yet entirely human * Washington Post * A look at mythology with fresh eyes ... In Circe the female perspective sharpens into focus in a way that doesn't happen in the original * Wall Street Journal * Miller excels at reworking myths and legends for a modern audience ... Miller conjures up a cast of strong  relatable characters  from cold-hearted gods and flawed heroes to deadly monsters-and best of all-a strong female protagonist. Fabulously readable * Scotsman * Beautifully written throughout ... Miller has broken [Circe] free of the conventions of the masculine epic * Literary Review * A refreshingly complex and utterly compelling portrait of one of the most intriguing women in western literature ... Miller's depiction of what it feels like to work magic is extraordinarily vivid and convincing ... What elevates Circe is Miller's luminous prose  which is both enormously readable and evocative  and the way in which she depicts the gulf between gods and mortals ... Circe can be part of that cycle of cruel and pointless conflict  or she can choose to break it. In this unforgettable novel  Miller makes us care about that magical  mythical choice * Irish Times * This is a gorgeous retelling of Homer's Odyssey blended with other legends. Miller creates a magical narrative: strong relatable characters  cold-hearted gods  flawed heroes  deadly monsters  and best of all  a strong female protagonist. Overall  it is fabulously readable * Herald * In Circe  Miller gives depth and history to the title character  how it was she came to be on her island  and her struggles as an independent woman. The ""heroes"" of Greek myths - the gods  Odysseus and so on - get shoved to the side  as Miller brings to the forefront a fascinating  captivating female character. This is wonderfully detailed and well worth the more than five year wait since The Song of Achilles * Stylist  The 20 must-read books to make room for in 2018 * A mesmerising  fiercely feminist and lyrical retelling of a story from Greek mythology - as enchanting as the enchantress herself * Psychologies * Circe is the utterly captivating  exquisitely written story of an ordinary  and extraordinary  woman's life -- Eimear McBride  author of A Girl is a Half-Formed Thing An epic spanning thousands of years that's also a keep-you-up-all-night page turner -- Ann Patchett Captivating ... Will entertain and enchant * Sunday Express Magazine * Horror  heartache and grit pour from the pages of this exquisitely written and compelling novel. An alchemist with words  Miller continues to rejuvenate the classics with her exceptional talent ... Circe is one of the best and most rewarding books of 2018 * Attitude  'Book of the Month' * Dazzling * Woman & Home * Gives Greek mythology a modern  feminist twist * Elle * Even better than its predecessor. Written in supple  imaginative prose  it conjures up brilliantly a vivid world in which the lives of gods and mortals are intimately intertwined * BBC History Magazine * Miller weaves an intoxicating tale of gods and heroes  magic and monsters  survival and transformation * i * A life-affirming tale of astonishing beauty ... A sensuous  thrilling experience  combining exquisite prose with high drama ... The pettiness and casual brutality of the deities is sadly recognisable in modern political times  while Circe's quest for validation will ring a chord with men and women alike * Toast Book Club * With her classicist's ear  Miller infuses her prose with Homeric rhythms  to mischievous and lovely effect. With nods to a wealth of ancient works  she crafts her own triumphant Circe ... Miller's Circe is a shrewd and cool character  capable of great love but also possessed of a lethally ruthless streak. Her mixture of assiduous domesticity and merciless witchcraft is addictively conveyed * The Lady * The exiled witch  who barely gets more than a mention in Homer's The Odyssey  is at the centre of a page-turning feminist romp * The Pool  Summer Reads 2018 * Miss Miller leaves us utterly bewitched * Country Life * Gorgeously written ... It leaves you thinking about it for weeks * Grazia * Madeline Miller's Circe stood out for me as hugely enjoyable  powerfully entertaining read  full of ruthless gods and unreliable mortals  in which the author (an American classics teacher) reimagines Circe as a damaged girl who uses witchcraft to protect herself from swinish men and discovers the ultimate power of human love -- Anne Chisholm * Tablet  Books of the Year * 				    	 					 About the Author Madeline Miller is the author of The Song of Achilles  which won the Orange Prize for Fiction 2012  was shortlisted for the Stonewall Writer of the Year 2012  was an instant New York Times bestseller  and was translated into twenty-five languages.

After the Prophet: The Epic Story of the Shia-Sunni Split in Islam Review “Fascinating. . . . Lively and engaging. . . . Anyone seeking to understand today’s Middle East can learn from this book. . . . Hazleton not only recounts the facts behind the split but also expertly uses centuries-old accounts to convey the depth of emotional and spiritual associations bundled within a simple word like ‘Karbala.’ . . . [She] deftly uses original sources  many based on contemporaneous or nearly so oral accounts  to give life and breath to figures familiar to every Muslim but unknown to most non-Muslims.”—Seattle Times“Illuminating. . . . After the Prophet will be held up as a primer for grasping the modern-day Middle East.”—The Miami Herald“Remarkable. . . . A story of human passion and consequence  told with consummate skill. . . . [Hazleton] manages the not inconsiderable feat of maintaining scholarly respect for her subject while also showing a real fondness for the people at the story’s heart—people who  we learn  were not unlike us  and whose tale is directly linked to today’s newscast.”—Dallas Morning News“Thrilling in its depiction of long-ago events. . . . Passionately and scrupulously done.”—The Wall Street Journal“As sectarian aggression flares in Iraq  Hazleton’s explanation of its deep  entrenched roots is essential.”—Christian Science Monitor “A remarkable and respectful telling of the story of Islam—a tale of power  intrigue  rivalry  jealousy  assassination  manipulation  greed  and faith that would have made Machiavelli shudder (had he read it)  but above all it is a very human story  told in a wonderfully novelistic style that puts most other  often dreary  explanations of the Shia-Sunni divide to shame.”—Hooman Majd  author of The Ayatollah Begs to Differ “A profound story masterfully told. . . . An exceptional book.”—Publishers Weekly (starred review) “A page turner that reads like an incredible cross between a suspense thriller and a fairy tale. All the elements of a fantastic story are here: intense spirituality  murder  violence  and bloodshed  dynastic power struggles  poison and atrocities  wife murdering husband  slave killing caliph  inspiring heroes  dastardly villains  heresy and apostasy. . . . The implications of [After the Prophet] are huge. . . . A superbly written first step for the uninformed to become knowledgeable. Don’t miss it.”—The Fredericksburg Lance-Star “Hazleton’s gripping narrative of the rise of Islam and the subsequent split between Shia and Sunni branches paints a picture that is far more epic  nuanced  and tragic. . . . Hazleton unspools this historically tangled tale with assurance and admirable clarity.”—The Bellingham Herald (Washington) “My only regret is that Hazleton didn’t write this terrific and necessary book in time to enlighten Donald Rumsfeld  Paul Wolfowitz  et al.  before they so unwisely invaded a land  and a religious culture  of which they were reprehensibly ignorant. I hope they read it now  with proper rue. Meanwhile  the rest of us can take pleasure in Hazleton’s vigorously drawn characters  her lucid storytelling  and her enthralling  imaginative grasp of the roots and consequences of the Sunni-Shia divide.”—Jonathan Raban  author of My Holy War and Surveillance “A new masterpiece. . . . Thrillingly and intelligently distills one of the most consequential trains of events in all history.”—Booklist (starred review) “Whether or not George Bush even knew there were such things as Shias and Sunnis before invading Iraq  after reading Lesley Hazleton’s gripping book no one will be able to plead ignorance about why the split between them happened and what it all means.”—Alan Wolfe  Director  Boisi Center for Religion and American Public Life  and author of The Future of Liberalism “Hazleton succeeds in bringing out the truly epic character of the Shia-Sunni split  telling the story with great empathy. The general Western reader will come away from this book with a newfound respect for the depth and power of the early schism in Islam and of what happened at Karbala.”—Wilferd Madelung  Laudian Professor of Arabic  University of Oxford  and author of The Succession to Muhammad  About the Author Lesley Hazleton is an award-winning writer whose work focuses on the intersection of religion  history  and politics.

Reading Dance Dance Dance is a bit like being taken blindfold on a joy-ride"" (Independent)""Mr Murakami writes metaphysical Far Easterns with a Western beat...there are echoes of Raymond Chandler  John Irving and Raymond Carver  but Mr. Murakami's mysterious plots and original characters are very much his own creation"" (New York Times)""Brilliantly combines elements of the surreal  film noir and existentialist enquiry"" (Sunday Times) 				    	 					 About the Author In 1978  Haruki Murakami was 29 and running a jazz bar in downtown Tokyo. One April day  the impulse to write a novel came to him suddenly while watching a baseball game. That first novel  Hear the Wind Sing  won a new writers’ award and was published the following year. More followed  including A Wild Sheep Chase and Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World  but it was Norwegian Wood  published in 1987  which turned Murakami from a writer into a phenomenon. His books became bestsellers  were translated into many languages  including English  and the door was thrown wide open to Murakami’s unique and addictive fictional universe.Murakami writes with admirable discipline  producing ten pages a day  after which he runs ten kilometres (he began long-distance running in 1982 and has participated in numerous marathons and races)  works on translations  and then reads  listens to records and cooks. His passions colour his non-fiction output  from What I Talk About When I Talk About Running to Absolutely On Music  and they also seep into his novels and short stories  providing quotidian moments in his otherwise freewheeling flights of imaginative inquiry. In works such as The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle  1Q84 and Men Without Women  his distinctive blend of the mysterious and the everyday  of melancholy and humour  continues to enchant readers  ensuring Murakami’s place as one of the world’s most acclaimed and well-loved writers."

"The Maudsley Prescribing Guidelines in Psychiatry From the Back Cover The revised 13th edition of the essential reference for the prescribing of drugs for patients with mental health disordersThe revised and updated 13th edition of The Maudsley Prescribing Guidelines in Psychiatry provides up-to-date  expert guidance on prescribing practice in mental health  including drug choice  treatment of adverse effects and how to augment or switch medications. The text covers a wide range of topics including pharmacological interventions for schizophrenia  bipolar disorder  depression and anxiety  and many other less common conditions. There is advice on prescribing in children and adolescents  in substance misuse and in special patient groups.This world-renowned guide has been written in concise terms by an expert team of psychiatrists and specialist pharmacists. The Guidelines help with complex prescribing problems and include information on prescribing psychotropic medications outside their licensed indications as well as potential interactions with other medications and substances such as alcohol  tobacco and caffeine. In addition  each of the book's sections features a full reference list so the evidence on which guidance is based can be readily accessed. This important text: Is the world's leading clinical resource for evidence-based prescribing in day-to-day clinical practice and for formulating prescribing policy Includes referenced information on topics such as transferring from one medication to another  prescribing psychotropic medications during pregnancy or breastfeeding  and treating patients with comorbid physical conditions  including impaired renal or hepatic function Presents guidance on complex clinical problems that may not be encountered routinelyWritten for psychiatrists  neuropharmacologists  pharmacists and clinical psychologists as well as nurses and medical trainees  The Maudsley Prescribing Guidelines in Psychiatry are the established reference source for ensuring the safe and effective use of medications for patients experiencing mental health problems.Praise for previous editions:'The Guidelines proves to be clinically useful and also accomplishes something larger. It lays out the ground rules for psychotropic prescribing without taking liberties that obfuscate the limits of our evidence… Thus  the Guidelines offers a different and refreshing perspective on prescribing  one that suggests that evidence-based  sometimes algorithmic  practices are possible  but that in situations within  and especially outside  those algorithms  decision-making is in the hands of the provider  sensitive to the patient's needs and values.'The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry'An excellent book and a ""must"" for practising psychiatrists… not only will the rational prescribing of psychotropic drugs drastically improve  but  more importantly  the patient will certainly benefit.'Human Psychopharmacology'I would regard this book as mandatory for any pharmacist directly involved in the care of patients with a psychiatric diagnosis  be they primary or secondary carer-based.'The Pharmaceutical Journal  About the Author David M. Taylor BSc  MSc  PhD  FFRPS  FRPharmS  is Director of Pharmacy and Pathology at the Maudsley Hospital and Professor of Psychopharmacology at King's College  London. Thomas R. E.

"BELL CURVE From the Publisher The ability to manipulate information has become the single most important element of success. High intelligence is an increasingly precious raw material. But despite decades of fashionable denial  the overriding and insistent truth about intellectual ability is that it is endowed unequally. In this audio presentation of The Bell Curve  author Charles Murray explores the ways that low intelligence  independent of social  economic  or ethnic background  lies at the root of many of our social problems. He also discusses another taboo subject: that intelligence levels differ among ethnic groups. According to the authors  only by facing up to these differences can we accurately assess the nation's problems and make realistic plans to address them. However  if we accept that there are intelligence differences among groups  we must learn to avoid prejudicial assumptions about any individual of a given group whose intelligence level may be anywhere under the bell curve. 				    	 					 About the Author Richard J. Herrnstein and Charles Murray The late Richard J. Herrnstein received his Ph.D. in psychology at Harvard where he had taught since 1958 and held the Edgar Pierce Chair in Psychology. He passed away shortly before the publication of The Bell Curve. Charles Murray  a graduate of Harvard who received his Ph.D. in Political Science from MIT  is the author of Losing Ground: American Social Policy 1950-1980. He is currently a Bradley Fellow at the American Enterprise Institute."
"The New Encyclopedia of Modern Bodybuilding: The Bible of Bodybuilding  Fully Updated and Revised Amazon.com Review Arnold Schwarzenegger hasn't competed as a bodybuilder since he won the Mr. Olympia title in 1980  but he remains the sport's No. 1 icon. He hosts an annual bodybuilding contest in Columbus  Ohio  and allows a column to be ghost-written under his name in a muscle magazine. Today's bodybuilders may have bigger muscles than Arnold ever did  but everyone inside and outside the iron game gives him credit for exponentially broadening the popularity of physique training. With this updated Encyclopedia (it was originally published in 1985)  Schwarzenegger wraps his huge arms around the entire sport. He hits the history of bodybuilding  the champions (he's quite generous in his praise of predecessors  contemporaries  and successors alike)  the training systems. Some of the information is more bodybuilding lore than science  for example  exercises are said to ""expand the rib cage"" or develop the ""inner"" or ""outer"" chest  all physiological impossibilities. But they're still good exercises  and the book includes every movement imaginable for every muscle group. If you love the sport of bodybuilding  you'll want this book in your library  if for no other reason than to feast your eyes on the hundreds of photos of the best physiques in the history of the sport. And  in a pinch  the 800-page encyclopedia can fill in nicely for a missing dumbbell. --Lou Schuler  About the Author The author of Arnold: The Education of a Bodybuilder  Arnold's Bodybuilding for Men  and the first edition of the Encyclopedia of Modern Bodybuilding  Arnold Schwarzenegger has won more bodybuilding titles than anyone else in the world  including three Mr. Universe titles. He lives in Los Angeles with his wife  Maria Shriver  and their four children."

Nussbaum  New Republic ""Is the world becoming a fairer as well as a richer place? Few economists are better equipped to answer this question than Angus Deaton of Princeton University  who has thought hard about measuring international well-being and is not afraid to roam through history. Refreshingly  Mr Deaton also reaches beyond a purely economic narrative to encompass often neglected dimensions of progress such as better health... [T]he theme requires a big canvas and bold brushwork  and Mr Deaton capably offers both.""--Economist ""[E]loquently written and deeply researched... For those interested in world poverty  it is unquestionably the most important book on development assistance to appear in a long time.""--Kenneth Rogoff  Project Syndicate ""A truly elegant exploration...

It will deepen both your appreciation of the miracle of modern economic growth and your conviction that the benefits can and should be much more widely enjoyed.""--Clive Crook  Bloomberg News ""This is a book that deserves to be read by as many people as possible  so that the poverty debates we have in India go beyond ideological grandstanding and the usual television dramatics... The recent years have seen several leading economic thinkers write excellent books for the ordinary reader  and the new Deaton book is firmly in that category.""--Niranjan Rajadhyaksha  Mint ""Deaton's lucid book celebrates the riches brought by growth while judiciously explaining why some people are always 'left behind'. He draws a distinction between the inequalities that are opened up by advances in knowledge and those caused by flawed political systems... The book's rich historical and geographical context adds to the power of this message.""--John McDermott  Financial Times ""In The Great Escape  he dons the hat of an economic historian to provide a fresh perspective on the march of human progress (and its pitfalls) that should inform our current debate about income inequality.""--Konrad Yakabuski  Globe & Mail ""It's a privilege to know the author of one of the most important books I've read  not least because it acts as entry point into other significant related books  research and debates...

There are thought-provoking chapters on the history of health improvements and what has driven them  on material well-being in the US  and on the damage caused by aid to developing countries.

Everyone who wants to understand the twenty-first century should read this book.""--Ian Morris  author of Why the West Rules--for Now""Deaton's account of global advances in health is magisterial. It is especially convincing in disentangling economic progress from technological growth as sources of health improvements. A very big story  this book should affect the way we think about human development and the role of science and science-based government programs. The language is modest and graceful  the use of evidence compelling  and the illustrations highly attractive.""--Samuel Preston  University of Pennsylvania""This factual  sober  and very timely book deals with issues surrounding the higher incomes and longer lives enjoyed by an increasing proportion of the world's population. It assesses improvements in conditions that would have seemed almost a fantasy for people living only a few generations ago. Deaton's arguments  written in an elegant and accessible style  are powerful and challenge conventional opinions.""--Branko Milanovic  author ofThe Haves and the Have-Nots""This splendid book discusses how  in the last two hundred fifty years  large numbers of people have achieved levels of well-being that were previously available only to a few individuals  and how this achievement has given rise to equally unprecedented inequalities. Unique in its focus and scope  exceptional knowledge and coherence  and careful argumentation The Great Escape is highly illuminating and a delight to read.""--Thomas Pogge  Yale University              See all Product description"

"The Psychological Impact of the Partition of India Review This book probes the emotional dimensions of the Partition  including the trama of those directly affected and its “trans-generational effects”. The book emerged from concerns that psychiatrists have treated the horrors of the Partition as a “no-go” zone  never attempting to seriously probe the psychological scars caused by the Partition. The magnitude of human suffering during the Partition was cataclysmic. Authors says that “it is strange and intriguing  the process of healing requires understanding and understanding the trauma and seeking resolution.” The book also probe whether the Partition “(unleased) an insanity which persists in day-to-day life  attitude  and ideology and whether “political trauma and social distancing  whether by fascism in Germany or other forms of social oppression  contribute to psychological symptoms. (THE TELEGRAPH  16 Jun 2018)Authors made the joint presentation on a subject that had hither to remained untouched in our understanding of partition- the long term psychological impact of the trauma of the moment and of the processes that followed. Moved  and intrigued  by the many stories they had come to hear form their patients- many of whom had lived through it- the doctors had begun to make initial explorations into the subject. Making sense of what happened is not only an ‘after-the-act’ phenomenon. As the editors show in their introduction and in their individual essays  politicians  bureaucrats  even Gandhi himself  were bewildered by the scale and spread of Partition violence. Other essay in this collection nuance this rich seam of exploration  providing connections and parallels with the impact of terrible violence in former Yugoslavia(where seemingly scientifically minded doctors and psychiatrists enthusiastically joined in the project of the demonization of the other and thereby implicitly supported the killings)  Darfur and Muzaffarnagar. They point out the everyday acts in which the seed of partition already exit in daily life and the ways in which states are complicit in creation partitions and forming divisions in order to control populations. (THE HINDU  CHENNAI  8th July 2018)This first of-a- kind collective  interdisciplinary inquiry into the impact of partition on the minds of people brings together psychiatrists  historians  sociologists and literary minds in a holistic examination of the psychological and sociology and sociological impact of Partition  especially at a time mental health and its consequence have become a modern scourge and yet remains the most misunderstood science. What caused perfectly sane and normal people individually to resort to collective madness? What led to orgy- on both sides of violence  assault and other abominations that they would otherwise have been ashamed of? What were the consequences on individuals  families and societies that had to bear the psychological scars of the Partition trauma? These questions are answered in this book. (THE SENTINEL  GUWAHATI  29th June 2018)This book probe the emotional dimensions of the Partition  including the trauma of those directly affected and its “trans- generational effects”.

I am very happy with what I got. --By Amazon Customer on March 30  2014Great book with low price! --By Ligang Chen on March 30  2015 				    	 					 About the Author David Freedman was born in Boto ani  Romania  as the first child and only son of Sara and Israel Freedman. Israel  a political refugee  immigrated with his young family to the United States in 1900  where four years later  David s sister Sophie became the first Freedman born in the U.S. Freedman graduated from the City College of New York in 1918  the first in his family to complete a formal education beyond high school. In September 1918  he married Beatrice (née Rebecca Goodman)  a fellow New Yorker  who was born in the city on September 27  1899 (her parents had fled from Kishinev  Russian Empire). Within five years they had three sons  Benedict (1919 2012)  David Noel (1922 2008)  and Toby (1924 2011). A decade later their only daughter  who is now known as Laurie Hayden  arrived. From 1924 on  Freedman was a self-employed writer. He created sketches for musicals and had shows on Broadway almost every year from 1926 through 1937. His novel Mendel Marantz (1925) featured a Jewish father who frequently made witty remarks. His first play  Mendel  Inc.  debuted in 1929. When radio replaced vaudeville  Freedman who already enjoyed a reputation as a popular  versatile writer was ready for the new medium. He was prolific  creating as many as six entertainment programs a week for several years  and eventually worked in movies as well. Freedman was also a biographer and wrote about industry insiders. His first biography  the Eddie Cantor memoir My Life Is in Your Hands (1928  ""as told to"" Freedman by Cantor)  became a bestseller and was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize. Freedman and Cantor collaborated on a biography of showman Florenz Ziegfeld  Ziegfeld: the Great Glorifier (1934) was used for the film Ziegfeld Follies (1945).

In the mid-1930s Freedman contributed scripts for short comedies produced by Educational Pictures in New York. The best known is probably Blue Blazes (1936)  starring Buster Keaton as an inept fireman. Freedman suffered a massive heart attack on the evening of Monday  December 7  1936. By the morning of the 8th  he was dead  leaving Beatrice  his partner of 18 years  and their four children  who ranged in age from just under 17 to just under 2 years."

"The Big Book of Science Fiction Review “A stunning and satisfying retrospective. . . . This is a complex and fantastic project. . . . It’s handsome  huge  and amazingly well-curated  our editors  here  have done a fabulous job. . . . I couldn’t ask for more  truly. It’s diverse  wide-ranging  engaging  and fun  the stories are introduced well  juxtaposed better  and the overall effect is one of dizzying complexity and depth.” —Tor.com“A definitive volume of the genre. . . . This is a big book  and it’s an essential tome for readers who are dedicated SF fans or casual newcomers alike. Do they manage to redefine science fiction? I think so.” —The Verge“The Big Book of Science Fiction is exactly what it says it is  nearly 1 200 pages of stories by the genre’s luminaries  like H. G. Wells  Arthur C. Clarke and Ursula K. Le Guin  as well as lesser-known authors. . . . [it] prizes diversity of all kinds  and translates work by several writers into English—some for the first time.” —The New York Times Book Review""How big is big? In this case  we’re talking nearly 1 200 double-columned pages  dozens of representative short classics of science fiction  and newly translated work from around the world. There are surprises  too: Did you know that W.E.B. Du Bois wrote sf? That’s just one indication that the VanderMeers hope to establish a more culturally diverse science fiction canon."" —The Washington Post (10 Hidden Gems)“An enormous anthology of science fiction put together by two of our sharpest purveyors of the genre. . . . This volume is a perfect mix of the classic and the unexpected.” —Flavorwire “Everything about this book is exciting. First  it’s huge—some 750 000 words fill its 1 200 pages. Second  it’s been compiled by one of sci-fi’s coolest power couples—she’s a distinguished editor (Tor.com  Weird Tales)  he’s a superb writer (2014’s Southern Reach trilogy). And finally  it’s not just another survey of white men in science fiction (aka Phillip K.’s dicks). For every Wells and Dick and George R.R. Martin  there’s work by Le Guin  Butler  and Katherine MacLean—not to mention stories from all over the world  from China (Liu Cixin) to Argentina (Silvina Campo). Gift it to a friend  then buy one for yourself.” —Jason Kehe  Wired (This Summer’s Must-Read Books)""Borges once imagined an infinite book with pages of infinite thinness. The Vandermeers approach that event horizon with this double-columned paperback of more than 1 200 pages  containing some 750 000 words in more than 100 stories. . . . A review of a few hundred words can only begin to suggest both the contents and quality of this excellent collection of short fiction. The Vandermeers sidestep territorial quagmires by defining sci-fi  simply and effectively  as fiction that depicts the future in a stylized or realistic manner. This definition allows them a wide range of choices. . . . This book could serve as a portal to years of pleasurable and thought-provoking reading."" —Milwaukee Journal Sentinel“Science fiction anthologies are a dime a dozen  but there’s that one that comes across every now and again that is truly essential. This is the case for Ann and Jeff Vandermeer’s Big Book of Science Fiction  an anthology that goes back to the genre’s roots in pulp fiction  all the way up to the end of the 20th Century  picking the best stories from around the world (including a number never before translated into English) . . . We took one look at this massive anthology’s Table of Contents  and fell in love at first sight.” —io9“Whether you’re a life-long fan of science fiction or layperson diving deep into a new genre  this incredible anthology offers a comprehensive genre education between two covers. In more than 1 000 pages and upwards of 100 stories  the VanderMeers have compiled a truly representative history of SF from its early beginnings to its myriad modern incarnations. . . . This is an unparalleled achievement  and undoubtedly one of the most important books you’ll buy this year.” —Barnes and Noble Booksellers’ Picks“When it comes to massive and comprehensive anthologies focused on a specific strain of fiction  the editorial team of Ann and Jeff VanderMeer has set the bar remarkably high.”  —LitHub“Ann and Jeff VanderMeer are a powerhouse editing team  their recent anthology of weird fiction helped define a genre  and took a smart historical global view while doing it. This anthology does a similar feat to science fiction  with an expansive aesthetic and work from a host of writers  including W.E.B. DuBois  Cixin Liu  Ursula K. Le Guin  and George R.R. Martin.” —Vol. 1 Brooklyn“These stories were chosen for continuing relevance and arranged to interplay like voices in a great conversation: shifting and offering new insights. . . . Throughout this collection  every piece of wrack  scavenger bird  and sorceress contains multitudes.” —Locus Magazine""A fun and solid genre education."" —Library Journal (Starred Review)""At 105 stories—taken from around the world and since the genre’s very beginnings to its recent heights—and more than 1 000 pages  this extraordinary anthology handily earns its billing as the 'ultimate collection' of science fiction. . . . The VanderMeers  longtime SF/F editors (The Time Traveler’s Almanac and many others)  provide a critical survey of the field as well as incisive biographies of the contributors."" —Publishers Weekly (Starred Review)“If your readerly appetite is not quite novel-sized  you’ll definitely want to check out this month’s short fiction offerings. If you only choose one title  make it The Big Book of Science Fiction edited by Ann & Jeff VanderMeer.” —Kirkus  About the Author Ann VanderMeer currently serves as an acquiring fiction editor for Tor.com  Cheeky Frawg Books  and weirdfictionreview.com.

"Animals and the Shaping of Modern Medicine: One Health and its Histories (Medicine and Biomedical Sciences in Modern History) Review ""This is a methodologically well-grounded book  full of documentation  on one of the major shifts in animal health history through the centuries. It illustrates a rarely explored aspect of current globalization that goes beyond internationalization  and illustrates the concept of `globality' in the life sciences with the logical consequence of medicine being fundamentally as unitary as life. ... a descriptive book that explores the development of a current phenomenon in society."" (Alain Touwaide  Doody's Book Reviews  November  2018) ""Animals and the Making of Modern Medicine demonstrates the distance that can be traveled  and the depth of connections that can be revealed  when we break through disciplinary boundaries and challenge the norms that define - and limit - our scholarly pursuits."" (Georgina M. Montgomery  Journal of the History of Biology  Vol. 51  2018) 				    	 					 From the Back Cover This book is open access under a CC BY 4.0 license.This book breaks new ground by situating animals and their diseases at the very heart of modern medicine. In demonstrating their historical significance as subjects and shapers of medicine  it offers important insights into past animal lives  and reveals that what we think of as ‘human’ medicine was in fact deeply zoological.Each chapter analyses an important episode in which animals changed and were changed by medicine. Ranging across the animal inhabitants of Britain’s zoos  sick sheep on Scottish farms  unproductive livestock in developing countries  and the tapeworms of California and Beirut  they illuminate the multi-species dimensions of modern medicine and its rich historical connections with biology  zoology  agriculture and veterinary medicine. The modern movement for One Health – whose history is also analyzed – is therefore revealed as just the latest attempt to improve health by working across species and disciplines. This book will appeal to historians of animals  science and medicine  to those involved in the promotion and practice of One Health today.              See all Product description"

"Born to Run: A Hidden Tribe  Superathletes  and the Greatest Race the World Has Never Seen Review “Compelling. . . . Entertaining. . . . [McDougall] uses an extended portrait of one of the world's least known cultures  the Tarahumara Indians of Mexico's Copper Canyons  to put modern American running under an exacting magnifying glass.”–San Francisco Chronicle “Equal parts quest  physiology treatise  and running history. . . . [McDougall] seeks to learn the secrets of the Tarahumara the old-fashioned way: He tracks them down. . . . The climactic race reads like a sprint. . . . It simply makes you want to run.”–Outside Magazine“Hugely entertaining. . . . One of the most joyful and engaging books about running to appear for many years.”— The Irish Times.“An enthralling story. . . . McDougall’s background as a magazine writer is readily apparent–his prose is light and airy  informative without being pretentious. Most passages are short and engaging with extra doses of drama and exclamatory phrases thrown in to great effect. McDougall wisely grounds the narrative in his own struggle to engage in the concluding race–he was frustrated with his tendency to get injured–and he offers insightful sidebars on a variety of topics  from the development of the modern running shoe to an evolutionary argument that humans are literally born to run. . . . A terrific ride  recommended for any athlete.”–Kirkus  starred review""A wildly fascinating story  perfectly told.

It's funny  insightful  captivating  and a great and beautiful discovery. There are lessons here that translate to realms beyond running. The book inspires anyone who those seeks to live more fully or to run faster.”–Lynne Cox  author of Swimming to Antarctica “Galloping along through a multi-faceted landscape that is by turns exhilarating  funny and weirdly absorbing  Born to Run is a breathless read  but sheer endorphinous pleasure.”–John Gimlette  author of Panther Soup""Quite simply the best book you’ll ever read about running. . . . Brilliant  and brilliantly life-affirming.""–Lloyd Bradley  author of The Rough Guide to Running“Born to Run is a fascinating and inspiring true adventure story  based on humans pushing themselves to the limits.

"Quarantine: Stories Review “There are great realistic relationship stories [in Quarantine]  of meetings  breakups  and the times in between...patrons will read it because of the promise evidenced by this young writer.” (Booklist)“Because Rahul Mehta’s characters are so richly and deeply rendered  because action and situation are so closely observed  these stories transcend all the categories that they are also determined to cut across. Quarantine is the best first collection I have read in over twenty years.”l (Madison Smartt Bell)“Quarantine is an insightful and compellingly readable collection of stories in which Rahul Mehta masterfully explores the emotions  the conflicts  the complex accommodations of being gay and Indian American.” (Manil Suri  bestselling author of The Death of Vishnu and The Age of Shiva)“Mehta’s voice is smart  intimate without being over-the-shoulder  tells secrets from the armchair  and always gestures toward something inexplicable and heretofore unknown in the next room. The stories in this collection make me want to burn money  to have more courage and to fall in love.” (Rebecca Curtis  author of Twenty Grand and Others Tales of Love & Money)“The stories in Rahul Mehta’s Quarantine amplify a surprising new voice: gentle  even tender  but powerful.” (Pankaj Mishra  author of Butter Chicken in Ludhiana)“A rich study of family ties  romantic failings and cultural disconnection told in crisp  clean prose” (Kirkus Reviews)“QUARANTINE is an extraordinary book that transcends gender and race and culture and sexual identity to speak to our universal humanity and the quest we all share for a self.” (Robert Olen Butler)“Traversing queer love  sex and the myths of cultural conservatism  this young writer…challenges the legitimacy of the American Dream.” (Lambda Literary) 				    	 					 From the Back Cover With buoyant humor and incisive  cunning prose  Rahul Mehta sets off into uncharted literary territory. The characters in Quarantine—openly gay Indian-American men—are Westernized in some ways  with cosmopolitan views on friendship and sex  while struggling to maintain relationships with their families and cultural traditions. Grappling with the issues that concern all gay men—social acceptance  the right to pursue happiness  and the heavy toll of listening to their hearts and bodies—they confront an elder generation's attachment to old-country ways. Estranged from their cultural in-group and still set apart from larger society  the young men in these lyrical  provocative  emotionally wrenching  yet frequently funny stories find themselves quarantined. Already a runaway success in India  Quarantine marks the debut of a unique literary talent.              See all Product description"

The Interpretation of Dreams From AudioFile Freud's most famous and polemic book presents a challenge to narrator Robert Whitfield  who interprets the heavy rhetoric with dispatch and precision  while relating the fascinating dreams with expressive interest and skill. The German text is translated into unstilted English  but the remaining French allows Whitfield to exploit his bilingual ability. Modern medicines have made psychoanalysis less popular than in its heyday  but the impact of Freudian theory on our civilization can never be ignored. For the curious and the serious  Whitfield aptly augments the exploration of this classic book just as a guide aids the tour of an old church.

"Atlas of Human Anatomy  International Edition (Netter Basic Science) About the Author Frank H. Netter was born in New York City in 1906. He studied art at the Art Students League and the National Academy of Design before entering medical school at New York University  where he received his Doctor of Medicine degree in 1931. During his student years  Dr. Netter's notebook sketches attracted the attention of the medical faculty and other physicians  allowing him to augment his income by illustrating articles and textbooks. He continued illustrating as a sideline after establishing a surgical practice in 1933  but he ultimately opted to give up his practice in favor of a full-time commitment to art. After service in the United States Army during World War II  Dr. Netter began his long collaboration with the CIBA Pharmaceutical Company (now Novartis Pharmaceuticals). This 45-year partnership resulted in the production of the extraordinary collection of medical art so familiar to physicians and other medical professionals worldwide. Icon Learning Systems acquired the Netter Collection in July 2000 and continued to update Dr. Netter's original paintings and to add newly commissioned paintings by artists trained in the style of Dr. Netter. In 2005  Elsevier Inc. purchased the Netter Collection and all publications from Icon Learning Systems. There are now over 50 publications featuring the art of Dr. Netter available through Elsevier Inc. Dr. Netter's works are among the finest examples of the use of illustration in the teaching of medical concepts. The 13-book Netter Collection of Medical Illustrations  which includes the greater part of the more than 20 000 paintings created by Dr. Netter  became and remains one of the most famous medical works ever published. The Netter Atlas of Human Anatomy  first published in 1989  presents the anatomic paintings from the Netter Collection. Now translated into 16 languages  it is the anatomy atlas of choice among medical and health professions students the world over. The Netter illustrations are appreciated not only for their aesthetic qualities  but  more importantly  for their intellectual content. As Dr. Netter wrote in 1949 ""clarification of a subject is the aim and goal of illustration. No matter how beautifully painted  how delicately and subtly rendered a subject may be  it is of little value as a medical illustration if it does not serve to make clear some medical point."" Dr. Netter's planning  conception  point of view  and approach are what inform his paintings and what make them so intellectually valuable. Frank H. Netter  MD  physician and artist  died in 1991."

"Ballad of the Whiskey Robber: A True Story of Bank Heists  Ice Hockey  Transylvanian Pelt Smuggling  Moonlighting Detectives  and Broken Hearts Review ""Rubinstein has found a story of the sort that would make even the most dry-mouthed journalist slobber. Sometimes sad  often hilarious and always absurd  Ambrus's tale microcosmically condenses the politico-historic oddities of his place and era into one entertaining and tidy narrative... With a keen eye for the ridiculous  fearlessly high-speed prose and an extraordinary wealth of reported detail  Rubinstein conducts the affair like an unusually thoughtful carnival barker.""―New York Times Book Review (Editors' Choice)""Outrageously entertaining... An essential absurdism is never far from the surface... A rip-roaring cops and robbers saga with a Mitteleuropean heart.""―San Francisco Chronicle""The antagonistic protagonist of Julian Rubinstein's picaresque romp is a real person who defies belief... Rubinstein rides the momentum in appropriately riotous fashion  but he wisely never lets his vivid style overshadow a tale that burns up the pages on its own momentum. Nor does he succumb to sentimentality when exploring the tale's pathos-and believe it or not  there's as much of that as there is burlesque. A memorable tragicomedy.""―Boston Globe""Julian Rubinstein's richly enjoyable true-crime saga... Mr. Rubinstein narrates all these farcical goings-on with a sad affection peeking through  even for the dumbest and most corrupt characters. But primarily he maintains that marvelously sardonic Eastern European resignation  that ironic tone of voice that always seems to shrug and say  'So what did you expect?'""―Dallas Morning News""Sometimes a book comes along that taxes even our best summarizing skills  but since we can't just really order you to read it (or can we?)  let's just say that Julian Rubinstein's Ballad of the Whiskey Robber  the totally bizarre true story of ice hockey-playing bank robber (and pelt smuggler  grave-digger  the list goes on) Attila Ambrus is one of the quirkiest and most riveting narratives. Here  the bad guys are the gentleman  the good guys are the bumblers  and nothing is quite what it seems  but that won't keep you from laughing out loud every couple of pages. Weirdness has never been quite so winning.""―Elle""Rubinstein has a knack for vividly portraying his stranger-than-fiction characters... By turns hilarious and incredible  this stuff just can't be made up.""―Maxim (5 out of 5 stars)""A wonderful read. Rubinstein's account of the Whiskey Robber seems straight out of Hollywood and indeed it's ideal for the big screen.""―Sports Illustrated""A beautifully crafted tale... In Rubinstein's deft hands  Attila becomes a great tragicomic character... Unlike many books today that run out of energy after the first several chapters  Rubinstein keeps up the high energy  madcap comedy throughout the book.""―Denver Post""This story of a bank robber who captured a nation's sympathy in post-Communist Hungary is a rollicking tale told with glee and flair.... Rubinstein has a knack for telling a good story  and he captures well both Ambrus's appeal and the atmosphere of the first few years of capitalism in Hungary... This Jesse James-like tale has the chance to be a sleeper that transcends nonfiction categories.""―Publishers Weekly (starred review)""Never was there a more entertaining case history of the fall of communism... Wholly enjoyable.""―Kirkus"

This is a masterful  philosophical and practical book that will give readers the wisdom to be able to do just that.” (Ryan Holiday  New York Times bestselling author of The Obstacle is the Way and Ego is the Enemy)“Mark’s ability to dig deep and offer amazing  yet counter-intuitive  insight into the challenges of life makes him one of my favorite writers  and this book is his best work yet.” (Matt Kepnes  New York Times bestselling author of Travel the World on $50 a Day: Travel Cheaper  Longer  Smarter)“This book hits you like a much-needed slap in the face from your best friend: hilarious  vulgar  and immensely thought-provoking.

He now brings his hard-fought wisdom to this groundbreaking book. Manson makes the argument that human beings are flawed and limited. As he writes  “not everybody can be extraordinary—there are winners and losers in society  and some of it is not fair or your fault.” Manson advises us to get to know our limitations and accept them—this  he says  is the real source of empowerment. Once we embrace our fears  faults  and uncertainties—once we stop running from and avoiding  and start confronting  painful truths—we can begin to find the courage and confidence we desperately seek.“In life  we have a limited amount of fucks to give. So you must choose your fucks wisely.” Manson brings a much-needed grab-you-by-the-shoulders-and-look-you-in-the-eyes moment of real-talk  filled with entertaining stories and profane  ruthless humor. This manifesto is a refreshing slap in the face for all of us  so that we can start to lead more contented  grounded lives.              See all Product description"

But what registers more is that here's a guy competing in an event that includes 38 000 feet of elevation change--the equivalent of scaling the Empire State Building 30 times.  Despite his considerable athleticism  ""Karno"" argues that the first half of any race is run with one's body  and the second half with the mind. Without delving into excessively touchy-feely territory  he explores ""the possibilities of self"" as he completes an ultra-marathon in 120-degree heat in Death Valley  and later the first-ever marathon at the South Pole. It's an odd combination: a California surfer dude contemplating how  as Socrates said  ""Suffering leads to wisdom.""

Bhagavad Gita According to Gandhi About the Author Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi (2 October 1869– 30 January 1948) was the leader of the Indian independence movement in British-ruled India. Employing nonviolent civil disobedience  Gandhi led India to independence and inspired movements for civil rights and freedom across the world. The honorific Mahatma (Sanskrit: “high-souled”  “venerable”)—applied to him first in 1914 in South Africa—is now used worldwide. In India  he is also called Bapu (Gujarati: term of endearment for “father”) and Gandhiji. He is unofficially called the Father of the Nation. Assuming leadership of the Indian National Congress in 1921  Gandhiji led nationwide campaigns to ease poverty  expand women’s rights  build religious and ethnic amity  end untouchability and above all  to achieve Swaraj  or self-rule. He attempted to practise nonviolence and truth in all situations  and advocated that others do the same. He lived modestly in a self-sufficient residential community and wore the traditional Indian dhoti and shawl  woven with yarn that was hand-spun on a charkha. He ate simple vegetarian food  and also undertook long fasts as a means of self-purification as well as social protest. Mahatma Gandhi’s birthday  2 October  is commemorated in India as Gandhi Jayanti  a national holiday  and worldwide as the International Day of Nonviolence.

"Our Mathematical Universe: My Quest for the Ultimate Nature of Reality Review Brian Greene  physicist  author of The Elegant Universe and The Hidden Reality“Our Mathematical Universe boldly confronts one of the deepest questions at the fertile interface of physics and philosophy: why is mathematics so spectacularly successful at describing the cosmos? Through lively writing and wonderfully accessible explanations  Max Tegmark—one of the world’s leading theoretical physicists—guides the reader to a possible answer  and reveals how  if it’s right  our understanding of reality itself would be radically altered.”Michio Kaku  author of Physics of the Future “Daring  Radical. Innovative. A game changer. If Dr. Tegmark is correct  this represents a paradigm shift in the relationship between physics and mathematics  forcing us to rewrite our textbooks. A must read for anyone deeply concerned about our universe.” Ray Kurzweil  author of The Singularity is Near“Tegmark offers a fresh and fascinating perspective on the fabric of physical reality and life itself. He helps us see ourselves in a cosmic context that highlights the grand opportunities for the future of life in our universe.” Prof. Edward Witten  physicist  Fields Medalist & Milner Laureate“Readers of varied backgrounds will enjoy this book. Almost anyone will find something to learn here  much to ponder  and perhaps something to disagree with.” Prof. Andrei Linde  physicist  Gruber & Milner Laureate for development of inflationary cosmology“This inspirational book written by a true expert presents an explosive mixture of physics  mathematics and philosophy which may alter your views on reality.”Prof. Mario Livio  astrophysicist  author of Brilliant Blunders and Is God a Mathematician? “Galileo famously said that the universe is written in the language of mathematics. Now Max Tegmark says that the universe IS mathematics. You don’t have to necessarily agree  to enjoy this fascinating journey into the nature of reality.”Prof. Julian Barbour  physicist  author of The End of Time“Scientists and lay aficionados alike will find Tegmark’s book packed with information and very thought provoking. You may recoil from his thesis  but nearly every page will make you wish you could debate the issues face-to-face with him.”Prof. Seth Lloyd  Professor of quantum mechanical engineering  MIT  author of Programming the Universe“In Our Mathematical Universe  renowned cosmologist Max Tegmark takes us on a whirlwind tour of the universe  past  present—and other.  With lucid language and clear examples  Tegmark provides us with the master measure of not only of our cosmos  but of all possible universes.  The universe may be lonely  but it is not alone.”Prof. David Deutsch  physicist  Dirac Laureate for pioneering quantum computing“A lucid  engaging account of the various many-universes theories of fundamental physics that are currently being considered  from the multiverse of quantum theory to Tegmark’s own grand vision.”Amir Alexander  The New York Times“This is science writing at its best — dynamic  dramatic and accessible. […] ‘Our Mathematical Universe’ is nothing if not impressive. Brilliantly argued and beautifully written  it is never less than thought-provoking about the greatest mysteries of our existence.”Publishers Weekly (starred review)“Tegmark offers a fascinating exploration of multiverse theories  each one offering new ways to explain ‘quantum weirdness’ and other mysteries that have plagued physicists  culminating in the idea that our physical world is ‘a giant mathematical object’ shaped by geometry and symmetry. Tegmark’s writing is lucid  enthusiastic  and outright entertaining  a thoroughly accessible discussion leavened with anecdotes and the pure joy of a scientist at work.” Bryce Cristensen  Booklist (starred review)“Lively and lucid  the narrative invites general readers into debates over computer models for brain function  over scientific explanations of consciousness  and over prospects for finding advanced life in other galaxies. Though he reflects soberly on the perils of nuclear war and of hostile artificial intelligence  Tegmark concludes with a bracingly upbeat call for scientifically minded activists who recognize a rare opportunity to make our special planet a force for cosmic progress. An exhilarating adventure for bold readers.” Robert Matthews  BBC Focus magazine “Max Tegmark is a professor of physics at MIT and a leading expert on theories of the Universe. But he’s also arguably the nearest we have to a successor to Richard Feynman  the bongo-playing  wise-cracking physicist who proved it is possible to be smart  savvy and subversive at the same time. […] now `Mad Max’ has been given the freedom of an entire book. And he hasn't wasted it. Around half of it is a lucid tour d'horizon of what we know about the Universe. The rest is an exhilarating expedition far beyond conventional thinking  in search of the true meaning of reality. Don't be fooled: Tegmark is a very smart physicist  not a hand-waving philosopher  so the going gets tough in parts. But his insights and conclusions are staggering—and perhaps even crazy enough to be true.”Andrew Liddle  Nature “Cosmologist Max Tegmark has written an engaging and accessible book  Our Mathematical Universe  that grapples with this multiverse scenario. He aims initially at the scientifically literate public  but seeks to take us to—and  indeed  beyond—the frontiers of accepted knowledge. […] This is a valuable book  written in a deceptively simple style but not afraid to make significant demands on its readers  especially once the multiverse level gets turned up to four. It is impressive how far Tegmark can carry you until  like a cartoon character running off a cliff  you wonder whether there is anything holding you up.”Peter Woit  The Wall Street Journal “Our Mathematical Universe is a fascinating and well-executed dramatic argument from a talented expositor.”Edward Frenkel  The New York Times Sunday Book Review""An informative survey of exciting recent developments in astrophysics and quantum theory [...] Tegmark participated in some of these pioneering developments  and he enlivens his story with personal anecdotes. [...] Tegmark does an excellent job explaining this and other puzzles in a way accessible to nonspecialists. Packed with clever metaphors”Nathan Gelgud  Biographile Nathan Gelgud  Biographile “Just a few years ago  the idea of multiple universes was seen as a crackpot idea  not even on the margins of respectability. […] But now  thanks in large part to Tegmark and his pursuit of controversial ideas  the concept of multiple universes (or a multiverse) is considered likely by many experts in the field.[…] Tegmark's clear  engaging prose style can take you down these exciting and unexpected pathways of thought without making you feel lost. [...] in Our Mathematical Universe  we meet a revolutionary cosmology physicist who is hell bent on figuring out if that theory is true  how to prove it  how to use it  and what it means for the world as we know it.”Clive Cookson  Financial Times“Today multiple universes are scientifically respectable  thanks to the work of Tegmark as much as anyone. [...] Physics could do with more characters like Tegmark. He combines an imaginative intellect and a charismatic presence with a determination to promote his subject [...] enough will be comprehensible for non-scientific readers to enjoy an amazing ride through the rich landscape of contemporary cosmology. There are many interesting diversions from the main argument  from an assessment of threats to human civilisation (such as a 30 per cent risk of nuclear war) to the chance of intelligent life elsewhere in our galaxy (lower than astrobiologists like to think). Written in a lively and slightly quirky style  it should engage any reader interested in the infinite variety of nature.” Mark Buchanan  New Scientist “The book is an excellent guide to recent developments in quantum cosmology and the ongoing debate over theories of parallel universes....Perhaps this book is proof that the two personalities needed for science—the speculative and sceptic—can readily exist in one individual.”Peter Forbes  The Independent ""In Our Mathematical Universe  Max Tegmark—a distinguished cosmologist—gives a lucid rundown of the current state of knowledge on the origin  present state  and fate of the universe(s). [...] It is immensely illuminating on the reach of current cosmological theories. [...] From time to time  Tegmark engagingly admits that such ideas sound like nonsense  but he makes the crucial point that if a theory makes good predictions you have to follow all of the consequences. [...] His concluding chapter on the risks humanity faces is wise and bracing: he believes we ""are alone in our Universe"" but are capable of tackling terrible threats from cosmic accidents  or self-induced nuclear or climatic catastrophes. He doesn’t cite poets but his philosophy adds up to an updated 21st-century version of Thomas Hardy's 'If way to the better there be  it exacts a full look at the worst.'"" Giles Whittell  The Times""mind-bending book about the cosmos"" [...] ""Tegmark's achievement is to explain what on earth he is talking about in language any reasonably attentive reader will understand. He is a professor at MIT  and clearly a fine teacher as well as thinker. He tackles the big  interrelated questions of cosmology and subatomic physics much more intelligibly than  say  Stephen Hawking."" Brian Rotman  The Guardian""Max Tegmark's doorstopper of a book takes aim at three great puzzles: how large is reality? What is everything made of? Why is our universe the way it is? Tegmark  a professor of physics at MIT  writes at the cutting edge of cosmology and quantum theory in friendly and relaxed prose  full of entertaining anecdotes and down-to-earth analogies.""Stephen Hirtle  The Pittsburg Post-Gazette ""Our Mathematical Universe is a delightful book in which the Swedish-born author  now at MIT  takes readers on a roller coaster ride through cosmology  quantum mechanics  parallel universes  sub-atomic particles and the future of humanity. It is quite an adventure with many time-outs along the way.... Our Mathematical Universe gives keen insight into someone who asks questions for the pure joy of answering them."" 				    	 					 About the Author Max Tegmark is author or coauthor of more than two hundred technical papers  twelve of which have been cited more than five hundred times. He holds a Ph.D. from the University of California  Berkeley  and is a physics professor at MIT."

Dracula (The Penguin English Library) About the Author Abraham ‘Bram’ Stoker (1847 – 1912)  was always unwell when he was an infant – he couldn't stand up until he was seven years old – yet he became a champion athlete when at university at Trinity College  Dublin. Like so many children whose health is poor Bram had lots of time to read and developed a real passion for literature.After university  Bram followed in his father’s footsteps and joined the Irish Civil Service in Dublin. He was soon bored and so built on his love of theatre to become the unpaid drama critic for the Dublin Mail. He met Sir Henry Irving  the most famous actor of the time - the two became friends and from 1878 until Irving’s death in 1905  Bram Stoker’s main job was as the actor’s manager and secretary. At the same time he was working as a writer. He wrote a dozen books but is remembered today for just one – Dracula  published in 1897. It is still regarded as a masterpiece of the macabre with its evil monsters and gripping story-line. Dracula was an immediate success and has remained popular ever since.

Eight decades later  he is still there  dispensing wisdom to pros and beginners alike. His stature in the golf world is reflected in the wide array of champions that he has worked with including those featured on this audio program  and it is not for nothing that the Teacher of the Year Award given by the Golf Teachers Association is called the Harvey Penick Award.

"Beartown Review I wasn't sure I would love a novel centred on hockey - but as with Friday Night Lights this is actually a story about people - about strength and tribal loyalty and what we unwittingly do when trying to show our boys how to be men.

No person's story is too little to be told  Backman includes them all. A novel with a big heart (Jönköpings-Posten  Sweden)A kind of problem play that moves extremely skilfully near the melodramatic without derailing. Its originality is substantial and the book credibly conveys the dual faces of everyday life. An impressive novel  like no other (BTJ  Sweden)Backman is a masterful writer  his characters familiar yet distinct  flawed yet heroic. . . There are scenes that bring tears  scenes of gut-wrenching despair  and moments of sly humor. . .Like Friday Night Lights  this is about more than youth sports  it's part coming-of-age novel  part study of moral failure  and finally a chronicle of groupthink in which an unlikely hero steps forward to save more than one person from self-destruction. A thoroughly empathetic examination of the fragile human spirit  Backman's latest will resonate a long time.

"The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari Review Everyone loves a good fable  and this is certainly one. The protagonist is Julian Mantle  a high-profile attorney with a whacked-out schedule and a shameful set of spiritual priorities. Of course it takes a crisis (heart attack) to give Mantle pause. And pause he does--suddenly selling all his beloved possessions to trek India in pursuit of a meaningful existence. The Himalayan gurus along the way give simple advice  such as  ""What lies behind you and what lies before you is nothing compared to what lies within you."" Yet it is easy to forgive the story's simplicity because each kernel of wisdom is framed to address the persistent angst of Western white-collar professionals. Here is the story of Julian Mantle  a superstar lawyer whose out-of-balance lifestyle leads him to a near-fatal heart attack in a packed courtroom. His physical collapse brings him into a spiritual crisis that forces him to confront the condition of his life. Hoping to find happiness and fulfillment  he embarks upon an extraordinary odyssey to an ancient culture  where he discovers a powerful system to release the potential of his mind  body  and soul and learns to live with passion  purpose  and peace. Brilliantly blending ancient spiritual wisdom of the east with contemporary success principles of the West  this inspiring tale provides a step-by-step approach to living with greater courage  balance  abundance and joy.

Fascinating.” (Wall Street Journal)“In Sapiens  Harari delves deep into our history as a species to help us understand who we are and what made us this way. An engrossing read.” (Dan Ariely  New York Times Bestselling author of Predictably Irrational  The Upside of Irrationality  and The Honest Truth About Dishonesty)“Yuval Noah Harari’s celebrated Sapiens does for human evolution what Stephen Hawking’s A Brief History of Time did for physics.… He does a superb job of outlining our slow emergence and eventual domination of the planet.” (Forbes)“[I]nteresting and provocative…It gives you a sense of perspective on how briefly we’ve been on this earth  how short things like agriculture and science have been around  and why it makes sense for us to not take them for granted.” (President Barack Obama)“I would recommend this book to anyone interested in a fun  engaging look at early human history…you’ll have a hard time putting it down.” (Bill Gates)“Thank God someone finally wrote [this] exact book.” (Sebastian Junger)“Sapiens takes readers on a sweeping tour of the history of our species…. Harari’s formidable intellect sheds light on the biggest breakthroughs in the human story…important reading for serious-minded  self-reflective sapiens.” (Washington Post)“It is one of the best accounts by a Homo sapiens of the unlikely story of our violent  accomplished species.…It is one hell of a story. And it has seldom been told better…. Compulsively readable and impossibly learned.” (Michael Gerson  Washington Post)“This was the most surprising and thought-provoking book I read this year.” (Atlantic.com) 				    	 					 From the Back Cover One hundred thousand years ago  at least six human species inhabited the earth. Today there is just one. Us. Homo sapiens. How did our species succeed in the battle for dominance? Why did our foraging ancestors come together to create cities and kingdoms? How did we come to believe in gods  nations  and human rights  to trust money  books  and laws  and to be enslaved by bureaucracy  timetables  and consumerism? And what will our world be like in the millennia to come? In Sapiens  Professor Yuval Noah Harari spans the whole of human history  from the very first humans to walk the earth to the radical—and sometimes devastating—breakthroughs of the Cognitive  Agricultural  and Scientific Revolutions. Drawing on insights from biology  anthropology  paleontology  and economics  and incorporating full-color illustrations throughout the text  he explores how the currents of history have shaped our human societies  the animals and plants around us  and even our personalities. Have we become happier as history has unfolded? Can we ever free our behavior from the legacy of our ancestors? And what  if anything  can we do to influence the course of the centuries to come? Bold  wide-ranging  and provocative  Sapiens integrates history and science to challenge everything we thought we knew about being human: our thoughts  our actions  our heritage...and our future.

The Psychopathology of Everyday Life (General Press) About the Author Sigmund Freud (1856-1939) is one of the twentieth century's greatest minds and the founder of the psychoanalytic school of psychology. His many works include 'The Ego and the Id'  'An Outline of Psycho-Analysis'  Civilization and Its Discontent and others.He was an Austrian neurologist who became known as the founding father of psychoanalysis. Freud qualified as a doctor of medicine at the University of Vienna in 1881 and then carried out research into cerebral palsy  aphasia and microscopic neuroanatomy at the Vienna General Hospital. He was appointed a university lecturer in neuropathology in 1885 and became a professor in 1902.In creating psychoanalysis  a clinical method for treating psychopathology through dialogue between a patient and a psychoanalyst  Freud developed therapeutic techniques such as the use of free association and discovered transference  establishing its central role in the analytic process. Freud's redefinition of sexuality to include its infantile forms led him to formulate the Oedipus complex as the central tenet of psychoanalytical theory. His analysis of dreams as wish-fulfillments provided him with models for the clinical analysis of symptom formation and the mechanisms of repression as well as for elaboration of his theory of the unconscious as an agency disruptive of conscious states of mind.

"Thinking  Fast and Slow (Penguin Press Non-Fiction) Review There have been many good books on human rationality and irrationality  but only one masterpiece. That masterpiece is Daniel Kahneman's Thinking  Fast and Slow.Kahneman  a winner of the Nobel Prize for economics  distils a lifetime of research into an encyclopedic coverage of both the surprising miracles and the equally surprising mistakes of our conscious and unconscious thinking. He achieves an even greater miracle by weaving his insights into an engaging narrative that is compulsively readable from beginning to end. My main problem in doing this review was preventing family members and friends from stealing my copy of the book to read it for themselves...this is one of the greatest and most engaging collections of insights into the human mind I have read (William Easterly Financial Times)Absorbing  intriguing...By making us aware of our minds' tricks  Kahneman hopes to inspire individuals and organisations to identify strategies to outwit them (Jenni Russell Sunday Times)Profound . . . As Copernicus removed the Earth from the centre of the universe and Darwin knocked humans off their biological perch  Mr. Kahneman has shown that we are not the paragons of reason we assume ourselves to be (The Economist)[Thinking  Fast and Slow] is wonderful  of course. To anyone with the slightest interest in the workings of his own mind  it is so rich and fascinating that any summary would seem absurd (Michael Lewis Vanity Fair)It is an astonishingly rich book: lucid  profound  full of intellectual surprises and self-help value. It is consistently entertaining and frequently touching  especially when Kahneman is recounting his collaboration with Tversky . . . So impressive is its vision of flawed human reason that the New York Times columnist David Brooks recently declared that Kahneman and Tversky's work 'will be remembered hundreds of years from now ' and that it is 'a crucial pivot point in the way we see ourselves.' They are  Brooks said  'like the Lewis and Clark of the mind' . . . By the time I got to the end of Thinking  Fast and Slow  my skeptical frown had long since given way to a grin of intellectual satisfaction. Appraising the book by the peak-end rule  I overconfidently urge everyone to buy and read it. But for those who are merely interested in Kahenman's takeaway on the Malcolm Gladwell question it is this: If you've had 10 000 hours of training in a predictable  rapid-feedback environment-chess  firefighting  anesthesiology-then blink. In all other cases  think (The New York Times Book Review)[Kahneman's] disarmingly simple experiments have profoundly changed the way that we think about thinking . . . We like to see ourselves as a Promethean species  uniquely endowed with the gift of reason. But Mr. Kahneman's simple experiments reveal a very different mind  stuffed full of habits that  in most situations  lead us astray (Jonah Lehrer The Wall Street Journal)This is a landmark book in social thought  in the same league as The Wealth of Nations by Adam Smith and The Interpretation of Dreams by Sigmund Freud (Nassim Nicholas Taleb  author of 'The Black Swan')Daniel Kahneman is among the most influential psychologists in history and certainly the most important psychologist alive today...The appearance of Thinking  Fast and Slow is a major event (Steven Pinker  author of The Language Instinct)Daniel Kahneman is one of the most original and interesting thinkers of our time. There may be no other person on the planet who better understands how and why we make the choices we make. In this absolutely amazing book  he shares a lifetime's worth of wisdom presented in a manner that is simple and engaging  but nonetheless stunningly profound. This book is a must read for anyone with a curious mind (Steven D. Levitt  co-author of 'Freakonomics')This book is a tour de force by an intellectual giant  it is readable  wise  and deep. Buy it fast. Read it slowly and repeatedly. It will change the way you think  on the job  about the world  and in your own life (Richard Thaler  co-author of 'Nudge') 				    	 					 About the Author Daniel Kahneman is a Senior Scholar at Princeton University and Emeritus Professor of Public Affairs  Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics in 2002."

"How to Talk to Anyone  Anytime  Anywhere: The Secrets of Good Communication From Booklist Larry King does how-to--in this case  how to make conversation. Unfortunately  he fails to tell us much of anything new about the intricacies of the lively art. Instead  he offers mostly old saws (look listeners right in the eye  don't monopolize the conversation)  and some of his advice is downright laughable. Larry sez: When you strike up a conversation with the opposite sex  avoid openers like  What's a nice girl like you doing in a place like this? ""Lines like this don't work anymore."" Oh  duh  Larry. There's another unintentionally hysterical section in which he counsels readers on how to talk to celebrities (""Ask Woody Allen about the New York Knicks basketball team  or Paul Newman about his charity work with kids""). Say  what a good idea. Next time I'm having dinner at Elaine's  I'll waltz right over and ask Woody about Patrick Ewing's health  though I'd rather know what the heck he sees in Soon-Yi. More interesting than King's advice are his recollections of broadcasts where the conversation was either terrific or turgid and his take on the good and bad guests he's had on his shows (Bob Kennedy  good  Bob Hope  bad  Bob Mitchum  very bad). Despite this largely silly book's numerous flaws  King's name will create demand  and  who knows  there may be patrons out there who want to know what to say at a funeral.

"The Last American Man From Booklist *Starred Review* Eustace Conway discovered nature's wonders as a boy growing up in South Carolina during the 1960s. Miserable at home  a born perfectionist and fanatic  he took to the woods and developed wilderness skills unknown to most modern Americans. By the time he finished high school and moved into a teepee (his abode for 17 years)  he was convinced that only encounters with ""the high art and godliness of nature"" could help save American society from its catastrophically wasteful habits and soul-deadening trivial pursuits. Conway is not alone in his beliefs  but he is unique in his maniacal drive to proselytize  and  ironically enough  he's taken his teaching mission to such extremes by attempting to create an Appalachian wilderness utopia that it's impossible for him to live the very life he champions. Tough  shrewd  gifted  vigorous  and contradictory  Conway  who set a world record crossing the continent on horseback in 103 days  both enlightens and confounds all who know him. Gilbert  a top-notch journalist and fiction writer  braids keen and provocative observations about the American frontier  the myth of the mountain man  and the peculiar state of contemporary America with its ""profound alienation"" from nature into her spirited and canny portrait  ultimately concluding that Conway's magnetism is due in part to his embodying society's most urgent conundrums.

"Healing Back Pain: The Mind-Body Connection Review ""My life before Dr. Sarno was filled with excruciating back and shoulder pain. For twenty years I also suffered from obsessive-compulsive disorder and thought my back pain was due to my height or some sort of spine problem and that my OCD was a chemical imbalance and only treatable with medication. But all my thoughts were wrong. Imagine the miracle in my life when in a matter of weeks my back pain disappeared. Imagine my shock when I applied Dr. Sarno's principles and never suffered a single symptom again. Quite simply - I owe Dr. Sarno a lot."" - Howard Stern""For fifteen years  my life revolved around my back. I took time off from work  conducted meetings lying on the floor and slept with ice bags. Could this be psychogenic? I had considered Dr. Sarno's ideas preposterous  but ten years ago I was talked into seeing him. I haven't had back problems since. If Dr. Sarno is right a about other psychogenic pain  America is wasting billions of dollars. What a tragedy."" - John Stossel  correspondent  20/20""John Sanro has changed my life and the lives of all the people to whom I have recommended him.

"Journalism through RTI: Information Investigation Impact (India) Review “A must-have and a must-read book for reporters  editors  researchers  all those who teach journalism and  of course  citizens too who can see for themselves what a 10-rupees demand draft and a powerful law can do.”   (Raj Kamal Jha )Perhaps no other journalist has utilized the RTI Act as often and as brilliantly as Shyamlal Yadav has done for a decade now. From high-level corruption to the junkets of ministers whose travel miles added up to 256 times the circumference of the earth  from insane asset declarations to money channeled to dubious NGOs  he’s exposed it all  using RTI. Yet  this fine and important book is more than the sum of his own outstanding stories. It is also a concise history of the RTI  its role in a democratic society  and the powerful tool it offers the investigative journalist. Read this book. Learn about RTI—and about our society. (P. Sainath )Shyamlal Yadav’s pioneering work on RTI has made him one of India’s finest investigative journalists. His book reflects his passion for truth and persistence on facts and will be an extremely useful reference and guide for any young person aspiring to join the media. (Prabhu Chawla )Shyamlal Yadav is an RTI activist of a different kind. He has married information to its rightful bride  the newspaper  and transformed it into an instrument of social change. The contents of his book show the range and depth of his inquiry. I am sure those who conceived of this law had someone like Shyamlal in their mind to take this law forward  both to expand and explore its potential and to make the powerful also accountable. RTI needs more Shyamlals. (Satyanand Mishra )Shyamlal Yadav not only masters to use the Indian Right to Information law as a powerful tool for his journalistic work  even more importantly  in his role as author  Shyamlal Yadav also masters the art of inspiration and sharing. His book includes detailed practical examples as well as necessary perspectives so peers and future journalists can learn from his experiences and at the same time be encouraged to ask their own questions relevant in their own context. — (Brigitte Alfter )Shyamlal Yadav is one of the main reasons that India’s RTI law is so powerfully effective. He has not only shown how to collect startling documents from government but also demonstrated that these facts can be turned into powerful stories that move people to action. To those who say that we are in a “post-fact” era  I say: Look at Shyamlal Yadav. He has already earned his place as a historic figure in the global freedom of information movement  and he has only begun. (Mark Lee Hunter )Journalists throughout the world who specialize in using access to information laws have learnt through experience that success needs care and determination. Shyamlal Yadav has used India’s RTI law very effectively to reveal important new stories  with persistence  thorough research and ingenuity. This is his impressive account of how he did it—and how others can learn from his example. (Martin Rosenbaum )The book illuminates the whole point about freedom of information and how empowering legislation around it can be… If you are a journalist  editor  or someone who works in the news media  it is worth a read.    (Business Standard  4 August 2017)A seasoned practitioner tells us how he has used RTI to great effect. In his advance praise for the book  Satyananda Mishra  former chief information commissioner  says  “Yadav has married information to its rightful bride  the newspaper  and transformed it into an instrument of social change.” Such words  coming as they do from a former chief information commissioner  ornament and highlight the worth of what is essentially a no-frills book that sets out how one man extracted information in the public interest from the coils of red tape – and how you could do it too  with some persistence… [It] is a veritable library of case studies: of interesting and apparently not so interesting (but relevant) questions  Yadav has found answers to the questions.     (Governance Now  31 August 2017)This book explains the potential of the RTI in India: to connect investigative journalism with critical issues of transparency and accountability in democratic governance.This story has all the facts that a person might want to know about RTI( Right to Information) The author  through his own experiences  unravels how news was collected through persistent efforts using RTI  this book offer answers to the challenges people face. (OPEN WEEKLY  9 April 2018) 				    	 					         		         		         	                  	         		About the Author Shyamlal Yadav is one of the pioneers of the effective use of RTI for investigative reporting and asking questions of the powers that be. His work on India’s polluted rivers  Streams of Filth (India Today  December 30  2009) was selected by UNESCO as one of the 20 best investigative reports across the globe. A member of the investigative bureau of The Indian Express  his reports like foreign travel of ministers and bureaucrats  MPs appointing their relatives as their personal assistants  bank staff putting their own money to reduce the total number of zero balance Jan Dhan accounts have had an impact and influence. He is the only two-time winner of the prestigious Ramnath Goenka Award for Excellence in Journalism in Investigative Reporting category. Shyamlal has been awarded with the Lorenzo Natalie Journalism Prize by the European Commission for Development  Brussels  Developing Asia Journalism Award by the ADB Institute  Tokyo  National RTI Award by NDTV-PCRF  Statesman Rural Reporting Award  and Ganesh Shankar Vidyarthi Award for Excellence in Journalism among others. He has addressed several conferences on RTI and Media at a range of platforms including Columbia University  New York at Rio de Janeiro  European Investigative Journalism Conferences at Brussels  Global Investigative Journalism Conference at Kiev  Asian Investigative Journalism Conference  Kathmandu.

"Art of the Cut: Conversations with Film and TV Editors Review  ""The greats like Schoonmaker and (the late) Coates are here. But so are the current blockbuster cutters like Eddie Hamilton . . . their methods and style are as individual as the individual themselves. And you as a reader will find yourself muttering ‘Absolutely’ or ‘Nope…that does not work for me.’ And you find yourself seated at the table as this masterclass is going on. And it’s a really big freakin’ table."" ―Book Review  by Jonathan Dowler  Canadian Cinema Editors ""Steve Hullfish has interwoven great swathes of interview and made them flow like a well-constructed movie. You get concentrated information fired at you from the most eclectic  dynamic range of editors from all genres  mediums and nationalities . . . Most editors  when asked how they do what they do (a question we are all perhaps a little tired of now) answer ‘Instinct!’ This marvellous book is the first I’ve read (sourced from many horses’ mouths rather than books written from a single perspective) to refute that. There are concrete techniques to learn here as well as aesthetic considerations that stay our hand or entice an ‘I’ and an ‘O’ on a favoured shot. There is something for every editor on every page whether they’re new to the industry or  like myself  with many decades behind me."" ―Book Review by Alan Miller  GBFTE’s First Frame  Spring 2018 Art of the Cut may indeed be the essential tool for the cutting room. Here is a reference where you can immediately see how our contemporaries deal with the complexities of editing a film. In a very organized manner he guides the reader through approaching the scene  pacing and rhythm  structure  storytelling  performance  sound design and music. I am placing this book on my shelf of editing books and I urge others to do the same. ―Jack Tucker  ACE ""In addition to having ready access to the experiences of so many editors in one volume  the book also makes great use of its formatting  structure and layout to enhance the learning experience and make sure you take away some practical wisdom."" ―Jonny Elwyn  Film Editor About the Author Steve Hullfish is a feature film and TV editor with credits including  ""Courageous "" ""War Room "" ""Champion"" and the theatrically-released feature documentary  ""Clinton Inc.""

In this collection of assorted horror stories  you will find noir horror  urban myths  fantasies  campfire tales  stories of phobias  gore  and even a story that takes place entirely on chat. An e-horror story  if you could call it that. Just like a rollercoaster is a source of unexpected adventure and you won’t find its shocks and thrills unless you actually ride on it  you won’t get the real experience of Right Behind You unless you read it. So  sit back  fasten your seatbelts  and plunge into the drive. Neil D’Silva is an Indian author of six published books. His debut novel Maya’s New Husband earned him a lot of things  including the sobriquet ‘the scariest man in Mumbai’ and an international movie deal.

"Learn Malayalam in 30 Days Through English Review I'm comparing the ""Learn Malayalam in 30 Days Through English"" with the blue cover to ""Learn Malayalam in a Month"" with the purple cover with swirls and the ""Learn Malayalam in 30 Days"" with the green. red and black boxes. I rather liked this book. It comes with quite a many words and sentences to learn from  and while it does sort of demand that you already have the alphabet memorized for most of the book  it gives a handy ""how to"" pronounce the alphabet and many consonant combinations. There were less mistakes than the other two and the pages were quite clean considering. They each have their pirks. ""In 30 days"" with boxes  while the book fell apart in my hands  has many vocabulary words and comes with conjugations in the present  past and future tenses and a longer dictionary at the back. ""Learn Malayalam in a Month"" with the purple swirls has the most complete vocabulary and consonant combinations combination of the three. Though I'm still not sure from all three how to say ""I' and pluralize. Njan or nan (I?)  gal (plural?) or something else. --Gina Moceri on February 10  2014This was exactly what I was looking for. I highly recommend this book and the company that shipped it. The shipping was timely and appreciated. --Pam Launius on October 24  2014"

Social Letters 
"Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow Review “Homo Deus will shock you. It will entertain you. Above all  it will make you think in ways you had not thought before.” (Daniel Kahneman  author of Thinking Fast  and Slow)“Thrilling to watch such a talented author trample so freely across so many disciplines... Harari’s skill lies in the way he tilts the prism in all these fields and looks at the world in different ways  providing fresh angles on what we thought we knew... scintillating.” (Financial Times)“Spellbinding… This is a very intelligent book  full of sharp insights and mordant wit... It is a quirky and cool book  with a sliver of ice at its heart... It is hard to imagine anyone could read this book without getting an occasional  vertiginous thrill.” (Guardian)“Harari is an intellectual magpie who has plucked theories and data from many disciplines - including philosophy  theology  computer science and biology - to produce a brilliantly original  thought-provoking and important study of where mankind is heading.” (Evening Standard (London))“I enjoyed reading about these topics not from another futurist but from a historian  contextualizing our current ways of thinking amid humanity’s long march–especially…with Harari’s ability to capsulize big ideas memorably and mingle them with a light  dry humor…Harari offers not just history lessons but a meta-history lesson.” (Washington Post)“What elevates Harari above many chroniclers of our age is his exceptional clarity and focus.” (London Sunday Times)“A remarkable book  full of insights and thoughtful reinterpretations of what we thought we knew about ourselves and our history.” (The Guardian)“Provocative...the handiwork of a gifted thinker.” (Jennifer Senior  New York Times)“[A] great book…not only alters the way you see the world after you’ve read it  it also casts the past in a different light. In Homo Deus  Yuval Noah Harari shows us where mankind is headed in an absolutely clear-sighted & accessible manner.” (Mail on Sunday)“Like all great epics  Sapiens demanded a sequel. Homo Deus  in which that likely apocalyptic future is imagined in spooling detail  is that book. It is a highly seductive scenario planner for the numerous ways in which we might overreach ourselves.” (The Observer (London)) 				    	 					 From the Back Cover In his critically acclaimed international bestseller Sapiens  Yuval Noah Harari explained how humankind came to rule the planet. In Homo Deus  he examines humanity’s future  offering a vision of tomorrow that at first seems incomprehensible but soon looks undeniable: humanity will lose not only its dominance  but its very meaning.Over the past century  humankind has managed to do the impossible: turn the uncontrollable forces of nature—namely  famine  plague  and war—into manageable challenges. Today more people die from eating too much than from eating too little  more people die from old age than from infectious diseases  and more people commit suicide than are killed by soldiers  terrorists  and criminals combined. We are the only species in earth’s long history that has single-handedly changed the entire planet  and we no longer expect any higher being to mold our destinies for us.What then will replace famine  plague  and war at the top of the human agenda? What destinies will we set for ourselves  and which quests will we undertake? Homo Deus explores the projects  dreams  and nightmares that will shape the twenty-first century  from overcoming death to creating artificial life. But the pursuit of these very goals may ultimately render most human beings superfluous. So where do we go from here? And how can we protect this fragile world from our own destructive powers? We cannot stop the march of history  but we can influence its direction. Future-casting typically assumes that tomorrow  at its heart  will look much like today: we will possess amazing new technologies  but old humanist values like liberty and equality will still guide us. Homo Deus dismantles these assumptions and opens our eyes to a vast range of alternative possibilities  with provocative arguments on every page  among them: The main products of the twenty-first-century economy will not be textiles  vehicles  and weapons but bodies  brains  and minds.While the industrial revolution created the working class  the next big revolution will create the useless class.The way humans have treated animals is a good indicator for how upgraded humans will treat us.Democracy and the free market will both collapse once Google and Facebook know us better than we know ourselves  and authority will shift from individual humans to networked algorithms.Humans won’t fight machines  they will merge with them. We are heading toward marriage rather than war.This is the shape of the new world  and the gap between those who get on board and those left behind will be larger than the gap between industrial empires and agrarian tribes  larger even than the gap between Sapiens and Neanderthals. This is the next stage of evolution. This is Homo Deus.               See all Product description"

"The Accidental Prime Minister: The Making and Unmaking of Manmohan Singh Review Few days ago  I was reading news paper and find a cartoon there  that was the time when Academy Awards were announced and in that cartoon it was mentioned that our three big politician were floating in the air (representing the success of the Oscar wining movie ""gravity) and one person on the ground showing similarity with our PM was appearing very happy with a trophy in his hand and it was mentioned 10 years a slave (representing the 10 years tenure of Dr. Singh as PM in NDA1 and NDA2). On that day I smiled but after reading this book  I do not have smile on my face but little bit happiness (I do not know why?) and sympathy for Dr. Singh. Before reading this book  I have an opinion that Dr. Singh has disgraced his dignity and strength  for the loyalty for Gandhi family but now since the facts have come out in an unfashionable manner  I am happy that at least he was not fully comfortable with what he was doing since last 10 years as PM of this country. The book has been written in very interesting manner  You will find that you are reading a TV serial and good thing is that this book talks about the people who are alive and are with us in the politics of the country. Well the timing of this book is slight late  I wish the things mentioned in this book could have been discussed publicly before the election. I know opposition will try to make its own benefit from the content of the book but the thing is that we all know that the power switch of the government was not in the hand of Dr. Manmohan Singh but in the hand of other person. I am sure that now Dr. Singh will be feeling relaxed  as this is something that even he would be thinking to make public for keeping his position clear. But again the last question from Dr. Singh  why you allowed this all rubbish to happen ? --Abhishek Shankhdhar Apr 12  2014Anyone calling this book work of fiction are living in a fictional world. Most of the things written  I could personally recall reading them in newspaper. The most curious part comes in the end and that's the nuclear deal. I had made some predictions and assumption about the deal.. which turned out mostly were correct. The book is very engaging  well written. People trying to figure out some intimate secrets about the PMO would be slightly disappointed  since most of the things are in public domain. --Chaitannya Mahatme Apr 20  2014Well  you would be  both  surprised and  not-surprised  after you read this. One side you will find a person who has risen from ashes  and achieved something unique and exceptional while striving as a nobody. You will applaud the compassion Mr. Singh has shown till 1991 and the kind of respect he gathered from his peers as associates. This book  very neatly  describes how a person with so high  an integrity and learning  succumbs to an authority  who intellectually  is nothing but miniscule when kept beside Mr. Singh  and while she remained dominating  how Mr. Singh remained unresponsive and numb to even raise his voice. Being a PM has always remained a matter of supreme pride and honor and responsibility  and as a citizen with a serious interest in Indian Polity  I have never seen any torch bearer of my country so incapacitated and helpless. He deserves this blame  as it was his duty to overcome such aggression and recognize what he remained for these 10 years. An Accidental  Numb PM. --Amrit Ravi Apr 24  2014 				    	 					 About the Author Sanjaya Baru was chief editor of the Financial Express and Business Standard.

"The Heart of the Buddha's Teaching: Transforming Suffering into Peace  Joy  and Liberation Amazon.com Review What should we think when on the one hand Buddhism tells us that life is suffering and on the other we are told to enjoy life's every moment? Loved around the world for his simple  straightforward explanations of Buddhism  Thich Nhat Hanh has finally turned his hand to the very core of Buddhism and conundrums such as this. In the traditional way  Thich Nhat Hanh takes up the core teachings one by one--the Four Noble Truths  the Noble Eightfold Path  the Twelve Links of Interdependent Co-Arising--but his approach is as fresh as a soft breeze through a plum orchard. For illustration  he dips into the vast stores of Buddhist literature right alongside contemporary anecdotes  pointing out subtleties that can get glossed over in other popular introductions. He also includes three short but key sutras  essential source teachings from which all Buddhism flows. Studying the basics of Buddhism under Zen master Thich Nhat Hanh is like learning basketball from Michael Jordan. --Brian Bruya  Review ""Thich Nhat Hanh writes with the voice of the Buddha.""--Sogyal Rinpoche""If there is a candidate for 'Living Buddha' on earth today  it is Thich Nhat Hanh.""--Richard Baker-roshi""Thich Nhat Hanh shows us the connection between personal  inner peace  and peace on earth.""--His Holiness the Dalai Lama""Thich Nhat Hanh is a real poet.""--Robert Lowell               See all Product description"

"Capitalism in America (Longlisted for FT & McKinsey Business Book of the Year Award 2018) Review This book snaps  crackles and pops... Readers will emerge from this heady blend of economic  business  and political history with a sense of exhilaration that so much of the American experience could be described so vividly and insightfully. (Robert Gordon Financial Times)Capitalism in America makes a strong case  with some wonderful insights into business history. Innovation  spread to the masses  is indeed the engine of capitalist economies. (The Economist)A superbly written book ... the tone is businesslike but culturally savvy - with sociological themes from ""America's urban nightmare"" of the seventies and eighties to ""the rising share of working women"" handled with sensitivity and skill ... Capitalism in America is an inspiring  rip-roaring read - like the astonishing story it describes. (Liam Halligan The Daily Telegraph)A sweeping and brilliantly told narrative by two authors who have spent their careers thinking about the wellsprings of economic growth. Anchored by the combination of Alan Greenspan's legendary skill with data and talent for analysis  and Adrian Wooldridge's knowledge and perspective on business history  Capitalism in America is full of insights that will surprise you and change your perspective on many of the key episodes of US history. (Liaquat Ahamed)A work of bold sweep and illuminating insight that tells nothing less than the story of American capitalism - both its extraordinary achievements and its darkest moments - from the earliest days in colonies ""at the edge of the world "" to the Internet revolution. At a time when ""capitalism"" itself is a subject of doubt and target of assault  this is a book that the times demand  and one that will contribute much to the debate. (Daniel Yergin)Greenspan stayed quiet in public. Later  he regretted his failure to more aggressively criticize Bush's policy. Nonetheless  he remains a wise  reality-based  patriotic thinker. But he thinks very differently than I do - and that makes him more worth reading. (Brad DeLong Washington Post) 				    	 					 About the Author Alan Greenspan worked as a Juilliard-trained professional musician before studying Economics at New York University  where he earned his PhD. From 1974 to 1977  he served as chair of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Gerard Ford.
